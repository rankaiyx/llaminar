# 🚿 llaminar
An LLM inferencing engine in C++.

Llaminar tries to solve a variety of problems encountered in other projects:

* **Tensor and Pipeline Parallelism:** natively supported, mix and match heterogenous domains.
* **Multiple vendors:** Mix and match CPU, ROCm and CUDA, simultaneously and natively.
* **Easy scaling:** Built from the ground-up on OpenMPI so you can scale out across a cluster. NUMA-aware by default. 
* **IaC-like experience:** Plan, then deploy.

## The Llaminar Philosophy

* Tensors want to be open and free: so is Llaminar.
* Tensors want to be sliced, sharded, and pipelined: Llaminar lets them be.
* Tensors want to run on a variety of hardware types without artificial handicaps: Llaminar helps them to do so.
