# vLLM-Style MTP Project Plan

## Objective

Port a vLLM-style MTP/speculative decoding architecture into Llaminar for
Qwen3.6 dense and MoE models on CUDA, ROCm, and CPU. SingleDevice is the first
acceptance target. Multi-device TP/PP/ExpertParallel follows only after the
SingleDevice contract is correct, fast, and covered by repeatable parity and
benchmark gates.

This replaces the old search for verifier-row shortcuts. The target is a clean
accepted-count state machine: draft state lives in speculative slots, target
verification produces accepted counts and output tokens, and only accepted
state slots are published to live model state.

## Why vLLM Is Fast

The local vLLM source shape to port is:

- `vllm/v1/worker/gpu/spec_decode/mtp/speculator.py`
- `vllm/v1/worker/gpu/spec_decode/autoregressive/speculator.py`
- `vllm/v1/worker/gpu/spec_decode/rejection_sampler.py`
- `vllm/v1/sample/rejection_sampler.py`
- `vllm/v1/attention/backends/gdn_attn.py`
- `vllm/model_executor/models/qwen3_5_mtp.py`
- `vllm/model_executor/models/qwen3_next_mtp.py`

The important ideas are:

- Draft proposal is graph-shaped: draft prefill and subsequent one-token draft
  steps use persistent input/state buffers and graph-capturable routines.
- Target verification is a `draft_count + 1` target forward: draft rows plus a
  bonus row, with logits indices describing target and bonus logits.
- Rejection sampling emits output tokens and accepted counts from device-side
  metadata. Greedy is just the deterministic special case.
- GDN/short-conv attention receives `num_accepted_tokens`,
  `spec_state_indices_tensor`, non-spec state indices, query starts, and token
  indices. Speculative state is isolated from live state.
- Full graph capture works because shapes are padded into persistent device
  tensors; no hot-path CPU sync is needed to discover accepted lengths.
- Publication is explicit: accepted speculative slots become live state; rejected
  suffix and bonus-ready rows do not mutate live recurrent/KV state.

Llaminar is slow today when it diverges from that shape: dense greedy still pays
extra verifier work through batched all-position LM-head rows, stochastic evidence
still includes stepwise/decode-equivalent cost on some lanes, and MoE verifier
paths are functionally green but dominated by target-forward and condition
forward time.

## Target Architecture

The target is a first-class speculative decode transaction, not a collection of
runner fallbacks. The transaction owns all metadata, draft rows, verifier rows,
sampling decisions, and accepted-state publication for one decode step.

```cpp
struct MTPSpecPersistentMetadata
{
    DeviceBuffer<int32_t> draft_token_ids;        // [requests, max_draft]
    DeviceBuffer<int32_t> target_logits_indices;  // flattened draft rows
    DeviceBuffer<int32_t> bonus_logits_indices;   // one per request
    DeviceBuffer<int32_t> num_draft_tokens;       // [requests]
    DeviceBuffer<int32_t> num_accepted_tokens;    // [requests]
    DeviceBuffer<int32_t> spec_state_indices;     // [requests, max_draft + 1]
    DeviceBuffer<int32_t> non_spec_state_indices;
    DeviceBuffer<int32_t> token_indices;
};

struct MTPSpecStepPlan
{
    int draft_count;
    int target_rows;      // draft_count + 1
    int accepted_count;
    bool all_accepted;
};

class IMTPSpecStateBackend
{
public:
    virtual bool prepareSpecSlots(const MTPSpecStepPlan&) = 0;
    virtual bool runDraftGraph(const MTPSpecStepPlan&) = 0;
    virtual bool runTargetVerifierGraph(const MTPSpecStepPlan&) = 0;
    virtual bool runRejectionSampler(const MTPSpecStepPlan&) = 0;
    virtual bool publishAcceptedState(const MTPSpecStepPlan&) = 0;
    virtual bool discardRejectedState(const MTPSpecStepPlan&) = 0;
};
```

Subsystem boundaries:

- `MTPSpecTransactionDriver`: one device-agnostic coordinator used by CPU, CUDA,
  ROCm, dense, and MoE. It replaces decode-equivalent verifier branches.
- `MTPSpecPersistentMetadata`: vLLM-style padded buffers for draft tokens,
  target/bonus logit rows, accepted counts, state indices, sequence/query
  starts, and masks. GPU buffers live in workspace/arena allocations; CPU uses
  the same layout in host buffers.
- Draft graph: graph-shaped prefill plus one-token draft steps using persistent
  input ids, positions, hidden state, MTP KV, and optional draft probability
  output. Draft sampling is fused when the backend supports it.
- Target verifier graph: one `draft_count + 1` target forward. It produces only
  the verifier rows needed by `target_logits_indices` and `bonus_logits_indices`;
  computing a full all-position LM head is a compatibility path, not the target.
- Rejection sampler: greedy is a deterministic specialization of the stochastic
  contract. The accepted stochastic target follows vLLM's worker fast path:
  draft proposal is greedy by default, so verifier `q` is one-hot at the draft
  token (`NO_DRAFT_PROBS` in vLLM terms); target rows are processed once, the
  first rejected or bonus row is sampled on device, and full draft
  probabilities are only an optional future lane for genuinely stochastic draft
  proposal. Compact top-k/top-p tables are compatibility scaffolding, not the
  MoE performance target.
- State publication: KV, shifted MTP KV, GDN recurrence, short-conv state,
  terminal hidden/logits, sampler history, and positions are published from
  accepted speculative slots. Rejected suffix and bonus-only rows never mutate
  live state.
- Backend layer: CPU/CUDA/ROCm implement buffer binding and kernels only. The
  accepted-count planner, metadata semantics, stochastic math, and transaction
  state machine are shared.
- MoE graph layer: routed/shared expert execution is graph-native and uses the
  same metadata. Expert routing scratch is transient; only continuation state is
  publishable.

Non-negotiable invariants:

- Per-device graphs only; no nested multi-device sidecar graph.
- Every GPU operation uses an explicit non-null stream.
- Every GPU scratch allocation uses arena/workspace declarations and
  `IWorkspaceConsumer`; no ad-hoc kernel-owned caches.
- TransferEngine handles host/device movement where graph-stage contracts do not
  already provide device-resident buffers.
- Fallbacks are temporary migration scaffolding only. Once a path is replaced
  and parity/perf accepted, the dead code and tests are removed.

Current Llaminar shape versus target:

| Area | Current shape | vLLM-shaped target |
|------|---------------|--------------------|
| Greedy dense | All-position verifier publication exists and is speed-positive | Row-indexed verifier logits and graph transaction |
| Stochastic dense | Batched sampler contract is accepted for SingleDevice CPU/CUDA/ROCm; performance remains policy-sensitive | Publish compact outcome/state fully from spec slots |
| CPU verifier | Full target forward plus batched all-position LM-head rows | Target/bonus row LM head and shared metadata buffers |
| MoE | Functionally green, speed-negative | Graph-native sidecar plus batched verifier/rejection |
| State publication | Captured-stage restore works | Spec state slots are the primary live-state mechanism |
| Graph capture | Improving per backend | Draft, verify, sample, publish are captured where possible |

## Current Status

Done:

- MTP config, sidecar loading, fixed/dynamic depth controller, per-request MTP
  summaries, and benchmark JSON/table reporting exist. Benchmark mode now
  aggregates request-scoped MTP counters across measured iterations after
  warmup and emits `measurement_iterations`, so acceptance/rollback counters
  match averaged throughput.
- `MTPSpecDecodeMetadata`, workspace declarations, upload guards, transaction
  counters, and accepted-count publication planning units exist.
- `MTPSpecStateContract` now materializes per-request `MTPSpecStepPlan` objects
  from metadata plus publication plans, including global speculative slot
  validation for multi-request batches.
- `MTPSpecStatePublisher` drives accepted-row publication through existing
  verifier-captured `IComputeStage` state hooks, can publish directly from a
  `ComputeGraph` in execution order, and hard-fails GPU publication without an
  explicit stream.
- `ForwardExecutionEngine` exposes the exact last cached forward graph, and
  `DeviceGraphOrchestrator` now has a runner hook that publishes only from a
  just-run all-position verifier graph with matching verifier rows.
- `MTPVerifierPolicy` has an explicit all-position state-publication path.
  `OrchestrationRunner` now selects it for greedy and device-resident
  stochastic runners that advertise accepted-state publication and do not
  require decode-equivalent GDN replay.
- `MTPSpecKVPublisher` now truncates main KV plus shifted MTP KV caches to the
  accepted-count invariant; `DeviceGraphOrchestrator` folds KV publication into
  its verifier-graph publication hook and updates logical position state.
- `MTPDecodeCatchup` now has a shared all-position greedy verifier contract that
  maps verifier rows to draft tokens, marks the accepted state publication
  prefix, and isolates rejected correction replay.
- Greedy and stochastic all-position publication have focused runner unit
  coverage for accept-all and reject-with-correction-replay cases. The runner
  now commits the first shifted MTP KV row before the all-position verifier and
  commits any additional accepted verifier prefix rows before state publication,
  so `MTPSpecKVPublisher` remains an invariant checker/truncater rather than a
  hidden state synthesizer.
- Depth >1 all-position publication now accepts a target verifier with a bonus
  row beyond the accepted prefix. Focused `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition` and
  `V2_Unit_MTPGraphConstruction` coverage proves partial-prefix publication can
  commit accepted shifted rows without falling back to sequential verifier
  replay.
- Request/session reset now invalidates request-scoped prefill graph captures
  with `PrefillGraphRejectReason::SessionReset`, fixing CUDA reused-runner
  no-MTP determinism after `clearCache()` without relying on logits gather.
- ROCm dense no-MTP fresh-runner determinism is fixed. Deterministic parity now
  bypasses ROCm flash-decode autotune trial rotation, because the autotuner is
  performance state rather than model state. Focused ROCm no-MTP determinism,
  ROCm MTP forward-only parity, and CUDA symmetry checks passed.
- CUDA/ROCm compact stochastic sampling kernels exist for top-k/top-p tables.
- `V2_Integration_GPUSamplingKernels` now includes Qwen3.6 real-logit-style
  seeded rows with close whitespace/code-token probabilities. CUDA and ROCm
  graph-captured distribution build and compact-table sample match the CPU
  canonical sampler on that fixture. Top-k ties are now a documented
  value-descending/token-id-ascending contract in CUDA, ROCm, and the CPU test
  oracle; this fixed the ROCm stochastic clear-cache repeatability drift where
  equal quantized logits could produce different draft candidate orderings.
- Dense CUDA/ROCm greedy and stochastic have parity/smoke coverage.
- Dense CPU/CUDA/ROCm SingleDevice Prefix+MTP parity now shares one declarative
  18-case test surface, including prefix restore, split prefill, dynamic/fixed
  depth, no-MTP determinism, forward-only MTP, and stochastic verifier coverage.
- Dense Qwen3.6 SingleDevice now also has a classic layer-by-layer math suite
  matching the Qwen3.5/Qwen3.6 MoE parity style. CPU/CUDA/ROCm prefill, decode,
  and snapshot infrastructure all pass with shared PyTorch snapshots, cosine
  thresholds of 0.96 prefill and 0.93 decode, and all first 8 layers gated.
- CPU stochastic MTP now uses the shared sampler probability/residual math on
  host for the decode-equivalent verifier path, while GPUs still hard-fail
  without device-resident stochastic verification.
- MoE CPU/CUDA/ROCm SingleDevice Prefix+MTP parity now shares one declarative
  15-case test surface for backend-neutral behavior, including stochastic
  verifier reuse after `clearCache()`; CUDA-only fused/grouped kernel assertions
  live in a separate path-guard suite.
- ROCm MoE stochastic parity no longer crashes or diverges after runner reuse.
  The fixed root causes were stale singleton MoE scratch bindings across
  workspace-manager ABA and ROCm shared-expert gate wrappers reading host-only
  gate tensors without ensuring device residency on the explicit HIP stream.
- The combined routed+shared verifier owner is not a production path. It
  previously handled the 256+1 slot shape but failed full-model strict
  continuation checks; production now requires split routed grouped verifier
  plus standalone shared GEMV-many verifier counters.
- CUDA and ROCm dense/MoE stochastic verifier parity now pass on the same
  all-position state-publication path.
- vLLM-style stochastic verification is wired into the GPU SingleDevice runner
  path using processed target logits plus device-resident sampled draft tokens.
  Draft proposals follow the vLLM default greedy draft branch, so the verifier
  treats `q` as one-hot instead of allocating full draft probability rows.
  Penalty-free and penalty-sensitive rows batch through the same processed-logit
  outcome verifier; penalty-sensitive rows pre-apply the vLLM speculative branch
  history per verifier row. Host-visible sampled tokens still keep their
  arena-owned device sample-slot readiness edge, so the batch verifier consumes
  device tokens instead of re-uploading host shadows. Focused runner units,
  `V2_Unit_MTPRejectionSampler`, `V2_Integration_GPUSamplingKernels`, and
  Qwen3.6 CUDA/ROCm dense+MoE stochastic parity pass after a full relink.
- The latest GPU stochastic matrix on the vLLM greedy-draft/one-hot-q path is
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260612T170149Z-gpu-stochastic-vllm-greedyq-c4096-post-moe-workspace/`.
  Dense is speed-positive on CUDA and ROCm: CUDA baseline/d1/d2/d3/dyn is
  44.7/52.6/52.6/47.7/47.7 tok/s and ROCm is
  31.3/37.0/28.7/27.0/36.9 tok/s. MoE stochastic is correctness-green but
  still performance-red: CUDA is 115.3/78.5/76.0/79.0/78.3 tok/s and ROCm is
  69.1/51.8/48.5/40.7/51.6 tok/s. The next MoE stochastic slice must reduce
  verifier/condition/sampling economics rather than returning to compact
  top-k/top-p shortcuts.
- Diagnostic probabilistic draft proposals were benchmarked in
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260612T175223Z-moe-stochastic-probabilistic-draft-smoke/`.
  They improve CUDA d1 acceptance to 75% but remain speed-negative
  (CUDA 77.6 vs 115.2 tok/s baseline; ROCm 49.1 vs 67.7 tok/s baseline), so the
  accepted architecture remains vLLM's default greedy draft proposal with
  one-hot `q`. The MoE work stays focused on verifier, condition, and outcome
  costs.
- Scalar GPU stochastic rejection now preserves the direct-publication
  logical-state mailbox as the next pending condition source. The host token is
  still returned to the caller, but the following fixed-depth sidecar consumes
  the correction token and logical position from resident device metadata
  instead of the host-token entry point. Focused
  `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition` coverage proves the path and
  `V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy` keeps the ownership boundary guarded.
- GPU stochastic MTP now follows the vLLM default draft branch: draft proposal
  uses device argmax, the processed-target verifier treats `q` as one-hot
  (`no_draft_probabilities=true`), and null draft-probability buffers hard-fail
  unless that contract is explicit. Focused coverage passed for
  `V2_Integration_GPUSamplingKernels`, `V2_Unit_MTPRejectionSampler`,
  `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition`, and Qwen3.6 CUDA/ROCm stochastic graph
  smokes. Dense and MoE CUDA/ROCm
  `MTPStochasticSamplingVerifierRuns` parity also passes on the new path. The
  production proxy in `V2_Perf_GPUSpeculativeSummary` shows rows=3 CUDA
  probability 3.96/3.81/3.69 ms improved to greedy-q 1.76/1.76/2.13 ms, and
  ROCm probability 8.91/8.93/8.96 ms improved to 4.79/4.78/5.67 ms for
  reject0/prefix1/all. Full-model matrices confirm dense speedups but not MoE
  speedups yet.
- CUDA MoE decode now declares workspace for Qwen3.6 top-k=8 gate/up fused
  fan-out. That path launches 16 logical projections but only eight active CUDA
  stream slots, so the stage reserves seven side-stream GEMV partial arenas.
  This fixes the former `[ConcurrentDecode] ... got 16` hard failure without
  reintroducing LM-head-sized global decode scratch. Regression:
  `V2_Unit_CUDAQuantisedGemmWorkspace`.
- Legacy full target/draft probability arena rows were removed from production
  `DeviceGraphOrchestrator` state after the vLLM greedy-draft/one-hot-q path
  became the accepted GPU stochastic contract. Compact distribution builds no
  longer materialize hidden full-softmax side rows, and the old scalar
  full-probability device verifier is no longer implemented by GPU runners.
  Guards passed: `V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy`,
  `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition`, release `llaminar2`, and a CUDA Qwen3.6
  MoE d1 stochastic smoke whose perf JSON emitted processed-logit batch verifier
  counters with no full-probability rows.
- A lower-memory draft-logit proposal/verifier branch is now implemented as a
  backend/perf primitive for CUDA and ROCm, with graph-captured integration
  coverage against the CPU inverse-exponential sampler oracle. It is not
  production-promoted: focused `V2_Perf_GPUSpeculativeSummary` shows mixed CUDA
  movement and clear ROCm regression versus the existing processed-target plus
  draft-probability path, especially reject-at-prefix-0 rows. This proves the
  next vLLM-aligned win is not simply "store logits instead of q"; it must fuse
  or lazily skip target/draft probability-stat work that cannot affect the
  accepted prefix.
- A one-block prefix-stop verifier was also implemented, measured, and removed
  in the same slice. It was graph-capturable and correct, but focused perf only
  helped CUDA reject-at-prefix-0 and regressed prefix-1/all-accepted cases; ROCm
  reject-at-prefix-0 was effectively flat and deeper prefixes regressed. Do not
  reintroduce a serial prefix verifier without changing the larger target-logit
  materialization economics.
- ShortConv1d and GDN recurrence stages now refresh their shared-kernel
  verifier workspace bindings from `onGraphReplayed()`, so captured verifier
  graph replay can publish accepted rows after normal/correction graphs have
  cleared stale bindings. `V2_Unit_GDNKernels` covers this regression.
- Fresh dense GPU release benchmarks prove the accepted-count path is
  speed-positive for greedy on both CUDA and ROCm: CUDA d1 is 56.91 vs 43.82
  tok/s and ROCm d1 is 41.44 vs 30.19 tok/s. Refreshed long seeded stochastic
  evidence shows matched CUDA/ROCm acceptance at 52 accepted and 12 rejected:
  CUDA d1 is 51.29 tok/s and ROCm d1 is 31.31 tok/s. ROCm stochastic is only
  barely speed-positive and remains below the CUDA-class win target.
- Bounded dense iteration matrix covers CUDA/ROCm/CPU, greedy/stochastic,
  baseline, fixed d1/d2/d3, and dynamic at 16 decode tokens. Latest full matrix
  is `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260609T061226Z-iteration-matrix-6753b5e7/`.
  Greedy is speed-positive on all three backends, with best lanes CUDA d3 66.7
  vs 44.6 tok/s, ROCm d1 43.9 vs 31.4 tok/s, and CPU d3 9.1 vs 4.6 tok/s.
  Stochastic is speed-negative on all three backends on this short seeded lane.
- Dynamic depth now has production-shaped exploration: standard matrix runs
  start at d1 with d1 as the adaptive floor, while d0 remains a diagnostic
  bypass lane. Demotion is stepwise, depth 1 only demotes to d0 after an all-zero
  diagnostic window, perfect probes can promote early, floor-depth windows must
  meet the promotion threshold before exploring, and a bad intermediate depth
  probes each un-rejected deeper depth once before settling downward.
  Focused controller and runner regressions cover d0 cooldown/probe,
  shifted-cache maintenance, stepwise demotion, perfect-probe promotion,
  rejected-depth hysteresis, and d2-bad/d3-untested exploration. The post-tune bounded matrix
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260609T-post-hysteresis-tune-matrix/`
  completed all CUDA/ROCm/CPU dense/MoE greedy/stochastic lanes with fixed
  d1/d2/d3/dynamic. Dense greedy is still speed-positive; dynamic is less
  cliffy but remains short-run conservative versus the best fixed depth.
- `V2_Perf_MTPDepthController` now characterizes dynamic policy overhead. The
  controller is scalar counter bookkeeping, measuring about 16-26 ns per update
  in Release, so CPU dynamic-depth tuning should target verifier, condition, and
  accepted-state publication costs rather than threading or vectorizing the
  controller itself.
- CUDA MoE greedy has parity/style coverage.
- CUDA MoE MTP sidecar M=1 now uses the same grouped-prefill contract as
  verifier M=2..4, avoiding the fragile runtime grouped-decode chain inside
  captured MTP sidecar graphs. The former fixed-d3 Release crash repro passes,
  and compute-sanitizer reports 0 errors on that lane.
- CUDA MoE rejected-token correction replay now treats accepted-state
  publication as a graph replay-state boundary. Accept-all steps may preserve
  captured verifier replay, but steps that require correction replay reset
  captured GPU replay and kernel dynamic state before the following main decode
  graph. `Qwen36MoECUDASingleDevicePrefixMTPPathGuards.Depth1CorrectionReplayResetsCapturedStateBoundary`
  covers the former fixed-d1 crash.
- CUDA MoE correction replay now narrows that replay reset to ordinary decode
  graphs while dirtying explicit stream bindings on preserved verifier captures.
  Bounded CUDA MoE diagnostics show verifier replay is now exercised for fixed
  d1/d2/d3/dynamic lanes, but MoE remains speed-negative because verifier plus
  correction time still dominates.
- Ordinary decode segmented captures now carry a live replay-state epoch.
  `DeviceGraphOrchestrator` advances that epoch after live-prefix/speculative
  state publication, and `ForwardExecutionEngine` recaptures stale ordinary
  decode graphs before replay while leaving all-position verifier graphs under
  their accepted-state publication contract. Focused cache/engine units plus
  CPU/CUDA/ROCm MoE stochastic verifier and depth-3 greedy parity passed; the
  release fixed-d3 sanity check
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260609T082255Z-gpu-moe-d3-versioned-replay/`
  preserved acceptance instead of reproducing the stale-capture collapse.
- Replay-state mutation policy is now an explicit typed contract rather than
  an implicit `decode && !all_position` check. `ForwardExecutionEngine` exposes
  read-only replay-cache observations for tests/diagnostics, and focused units
  assert the correction boundary resets ordinary decode replay while preserving
  verifier replay only for stream rebinding. The bounded deep correctness gate
  passed on CPU/CUDA/ROCm dense and MoE depth-3 greedy plus stochastic verifier
  parity.
- `DeviceGraphOrchestrator` now exposes read-only live replay-state epoch and
  replay-cache observations, wired to the orchestrator's current epoch. A
  focused CPU unit proves live checkpoint restore advances the state-version
  contract without marking CPU graph-cache identities stale, and the same deep
  CPU/CUDA/ROCm dense+MoE depth-3 greedy/stochastic verifier parity guard passed
  after the diagnostic hook landed.
- CPU stochastic all-position publication now uses the same accepted-state
  publication contract as CUDA/ROCm, with host-side target/draft distributions
  built from the shared sampler probability and residual math. Focused runner
  units cover host accept and reject/correction cases, and the backend-symmetric
  dense+MoE CPU/CUDA/ROCm depth-3 greedy plus stochastic verifier parity gate
  passed after the parity contract was tightened to reject the old
  decode-equivalent fallback.
- CPU hybrid state export/import now builds deterministic host-copy spans and
  copies large recurrence/short-conv payloads through the existing OpenMP
  workshare pattern. CPU accepted-state publication also restores independent
  verifier-captured stages in parallel while keeping GPU publication ordered on
  the explicit stream. `V2_Unit_HybridKVCache`, `V2_Unit_MTPSpecStateContract`,
  and `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition` cover the parallel copy and publication
  contracts.
- CPU sampler top-k distribution building now uses an ISA-dispatched
  scalar/AVX2/AVX512 top-k primitive in the Qwen chat/MTP compact top-k path,
  avoiding the former full-vocab `pair` allocation plus `partial_sort`.
  `V2_Unit_Sampler` proves scalar, AVX2, and AVX512 top-k equivalence and
  distribution parity with the old partial-sort baseline. `V2_Perf_CPUSamplerTopK`
  on a 151,936-token Qwen-style vocabulary measured old/new distribution build
  times of 0.190846/0.020120 ms for top-k 20, 0.187209/0.028611 ms for top-k
  40, and 0.262855/0.225518 ms for top-k 256.
- CPU dense Qwen3.6 Prefix/MTP parity no longer spins up redundant no-MTP
  baseline runners inside prefix restore, split-prefill, fixed/dynamic MTP, or
  stochastic verifier helpers when the PyTorch decode token fixture already
  provides the correctness oracle. Focused CTest reruns show the former slow
  cells now cluster around 41-43s: split prefill 42.63s, fixed d3 MTP 41.81s,
  stochastic verifier 43.15s, and dynamic MTP 42.55s. Dedicated no-MTP and
  determinism tests remain intact.
- Rejected-token all-position publication no longer runs an expensive same-step
  correction main forward. The runner now emits the correction token, commits
  its shifted MTP row from current terminal hidden so the sidecar cache remains
  aligned, records `deferred_correction_condition_tokens`, and defers the
  correction token's main-model condition forward to the next ordinary decode
  step. Focused units and
  `Qwen36MoECUDASingleDevicePrefixMTPPathGuards.Depth1RejectedCorrectionDefersToConditionToken`
  cover this split; fresh CUDA/ROCm GPU matrices show `correction_ms=0` and
  zero rollback, but MoE remains speed-negative because verifier time dominates.
- Greedy GPU all-position verifier replay can now defer the verifier graph's
  final stream sync and hand the capture stream directly to device-side row
  sampling. The handoff is scoped by `OrchestrationRunner`, hard-fails if a
  backend cannot sample on the handed-off stream, and is deliberately disabled
  for stochastic verification until its multi-kernel distribution path has the
  same stream contract. `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition`,
  `V2_Unit_ForwardExecutionEngine`, `V2_Unit_MTPGraphConstruction`, and focused
  CUDA/ROCm Qwen3.6 MoE d3+stochastic parity passed. Release check
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260609T085703Z-gpu-moe-d3-verifier-stream-handoff/`
  shows the counters firing with zero rollback/correction replay, but still no
  MoE speed-positive result: CUDA d3 70.3 vs 109.8 tok/s and ROCm d3 42.4 vs
  64.7 tok/s. The CPU Qwen3.6 MoE d3+stochastic parity cells also passed as
  the non-GPU replay-state guard.
- All-position publication no longer captures the old post-sidecar prefix
  checkpoint, because that verifier path publishes from the just-run target
  graph and never restores the sidecar checkpoint. The decode-equivalent path
  keeps its checkpoint until CPU/host verifier publication is replaced.
  `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition` covers the skip counter and absence of the
  old checkpoint timer; the fresh bounded matrix confirms GPU all-position lanes
  emit `post_sidecar_checkpoint_skipped_all_position_publication` instead.
- CUDA MoE graph-captured no-MTP baseline decode crash is fixed. Root cause was
  a split-K down-partials workspace contract mismatch plus missing expert-id
  upper-bound guards in CUDA MoE grouped k-part kernels. The focused regression
  `RuntimeRouteSelectAndFusedDecodeCaptureWithLargeExpertTable` now captures
  route selection plus fused grouped expert decode against a Qwen3.6-scale
  expert table.
- ROCm MoE shared-expert grouped prefill preparation is now graph-native enough
  for verifier/shared-expert grouped routes. It declares workspace buffers,
  prepares implicit shared-expert group metadata on the explicit HIP stream, and
  has focused `V2_Unit_PrefillGraphCapturability` plus
  `ROCmMoEKernel.SharedExpertGroupedPrefillMatchesSequentialPath` coverage.
- ROCm and CUDA MoE verifier-prefill now use graph-capturable combined
  routed/shared verifier launches for Qwen3.6-scale M=2/3/4 rows. Focused
  production-shape perf correctness is cosine 1.0 on both backends. Fresh
  focused timings from `V2_Perf_MoEVerifierPrefill` show CUDA graph M=2/3/4 at
  about 0.117/0.151/0.176 ms and ROCm graph M=2/3/4 at about
  0.237/0.266/0.303 ms, so isolated expert-prefill kernels are no longer the
  only MoE blocker.
- ROCm GDN concurrent decode is now promoted to the default outside
  deterministic mode. Focused coverage `V2_Unit_GDNKernels` and
  `V2_Unit_DeterministicMode` proves the default and deterministic override.
  No-env probe
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260612T_rocm_moe_gdn_default_probe/`
  shows ROCm MoE greedy fixed d3 at 92.1 tok/s versus 77.3 baseline (1.19x)
  with 81.5% acceptance. ROCm MoE stochastic remains rejected for performance:
  dynamic is 61.7 tok/s versus 78.0 baseline and fixed d3 acceptance is only
  30.6%, so the next accepted MoE slice must reduce stochastic target
  distribution/verifier work rather than toggling more concurrency flags.
- The focused ROCm MoE parity gate exposed a loader contract regression before
  it reached math comparison: integration tests could enter `load()` with a
  GPU pool but no pinned upload ring. The fix clamps the repack stream count at
  the `WeightManager` call site and makes `LoadOrchestrator::allocate()` reject
  pinned staging with zero H2D streams. Regression coverage:
  `V2_Unit_LoadOrchestrator`, serial
  `MTPStochasticSamplingVerifierRuns`,
  `MainVerifierAllPositionRowsMatchSerialDecode`,
  `MTPGreedyDepth3MatchesBaselineTokens`, and
  `MTPBenchmarkStyleDepth3LongPromptGreedyMatchesReference`.
- ROCm stochastic small-k partial-block sweep is rejected as a performance
  fix. `20260612T_rocm_moe_stochastic_topk_partial_sweep` tested caps
  16/32/64/128; best dynamic was cap 64 at 64.0 tok/s versus a 77.7 tok/s
  baseline, and fixed d3 stayed around 0.58x. Keep the automatic/default
  partial-block policy and move to fused/lazy stochastic verifier work that
  avoids building target/bonus distributions for rows that cannot be consumed
  after an early rejection.
- Generated MTP depth policy now keys on backend plus dense/MoE model class,
  emits direct target-depth deltas and learned hold rows, and uses hold rows as
  dynamic warm starts. Focused trainer/controller units pass. Diagnostic MoE
  smoke `20260611T-moe-generated-best-depth-guard-smoke` shows ROCm greedy
  dynamic stable at depth 3 with 96.2 vs 78.8 tok/s; CUDA MoE remains
  verifier-bound at 122.2 vs 143.8 tok/s.
- Dynamic MoE greedy now gives the generated best-depth lane one
  non-catastrophic full-window grace period before demoting. This fixes the
  ROCm depth-3 churn found in
  `20260612T_moe_rocm_splitk_depth_matrix`: a first window with
  acceptance=0.395833 and zero_accept=0.375 demoted even though fixed d3 won
  the whole request. `V2_Unit_MTPDepthController` covers that exact window and
  the second-consecutive-bad-window demotion escape hatch. Focused matrix
  `20260612T_moe_gpu_greedy_dynamic_grace` shows CUDA dynamic 147.2 vs 138.5
  baseline and ROCm dynamic 94.2 vs 78.0 baseline, both with zero demotions.
- Current MoE same-run matrices are
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260612T_moe_cuda_splitk_depth_matrix/`,
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260612T_moe_rocm_splitk_depth_matrix/`,
  and
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260612T_moe_gpu_stochastic_refresh/`.
  CUDA greedy is correct but only weakly positive: fixed d3 is 146.8 tok/s vs
  139.2 baseline (1.05x). ROCm greedy is better but still short of dense-class
  wins: fixed d3 is 97.9 tok/s vs 77.3 baseline (1.27x). CUDA stochastic is
  still negative with best dynamic at 133.1 vs 139.2 tok/s. ROCm stochastic is
  still negative with best dynamic at 66.7 vs 77.8 tok/s.
- CUDA MoE tuning has rejected the latest gate/up=32, down=16, tile-M=2 full
  model A/B even though it helped isolated shapes: real d3 fell to 144.5 tok/s.
  Do not revive one-off tile/kpart overrides without a same-run matrix win.
  CUDA's next MoE target is verifier/condition transaction economics across
  the full 40-layer graph, not the already-fast isolated combined expert
  prefill kernel.
- ROCm stochastic attribution now shows the compact D2H copy itself is small in
  isolation, about 0.04 ms. The real cost is the queued GPU work before that
  host-visible boundary, especially Qwen-sized top-k/top-p target and draft
  distribution builds. `V2_Perf_GPUSpeculativeSummary` shows ROCm stochastic
  rows 1/2/3 at about 5.13/5.79/6.50 ms, dominated by target/draft
  distribution build, while CUDA is about 1.59/1.92/2.21 ms. A durable ROCm
  stochastic MoE win likely needs a lazy or fused target-distribution verifier
  that avoids bonus/later-row top-k work after early rejection, not another
  host read tweak.
- Focused MoE GPU sprint
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260612T120836Z-moe-gpu-focused-sprint/`
  confirms that compact verifier polishing is the wrong center of gravity.
  CUDA MoE stochastic is still speed-negative despite high d1 acceptance
  (90.6%), while ROCm MoE stochastic has both poor speed and very different
  acceptance (45.8/56.9/31.3% for d1/d2/d3). The follow-up architecture slice
  proved the useful vLLM idea is not persistent full target/draft probability
  rows; it is greedy draft proposal, processed target rows, one-hot `q`, and a
  batched device outcome that can sample the rejected or bonus row without host
  participation.
- The first vLLM-style recovered-token primitive is implemented as a shared
  CPU reference plus CUDA/ROCm graph-capturable backend kernels. Focused gates
  passed: `V2_Unit_MTPRejectionSampler`,
  `V2_Integration_GPUSamplingKernels`, and `V2_Perf_GPUSpeculativeSummary`.
  Direct perf for `StochasticFullProbabilityQwen36Rows` shows rejection
  recovery itself is not the remaining MoE blocker: CUDA M=1/2/3 is about
  0.146/0.152/0.223 ms and ROCm is about 1.196/1.208/1.195 ms for Qwen-sized
  rows. Graph-capturable processed-logit softmax materialization is now also
  implemented and covered in the same GPU sampler/perf gates. Direct perf for
  `ProcessedLogitSoftmaxQwen36Rows` is CUDA M=1/2/3 about
  0.425/0.425/0.426 ms and ROCm about 0.969/1.013/1.143 ms. The accepted
  production slice wires processed target logits, device-resident draft tokens,
  one-hot `q`, and the existing stochastic summary reducer instead of allocating
  persistent full-probability buffers.
- The first lazy-target proof is deliberately perf-harness-only, not a
  production path. `Perf__GPUSpeculativeSummary.StochasticLazyTargetQwen36Rows`
  uses real backend kernels with deterministic accepted-prefix fixtures. It
  shows a host-loop lazy verifier is not viable: ROCm M=3 reject-at-0 is
  slightly cheaper than eager (about 6.00 ms vs 6.50 ms), but reject-after-1 and
  accept-all are much worse (about 8.54 ms and 13.37 ms). If we pursue lazy
  target verification, it must be one fused GPU-side reducer that scans rows
  until rejection without per-row host-visible boundaries.
- The old production compact lazy-bonus A/B was rejected and removed.
  Diagnostic matrices `20260612T_lazy_bonus_off_moe_stochastic_diag` and
  `20260612T_lazy_bonus_on_moe_stochastic_diag` showed CUDA dynamic falling
  from 136.0 to 130.2 tok/s and ROCm dynamic from 61.7 to 59.6 tok/s; only ROCm
  fixed d3 moved from 43.9 to 44.8 tok/s, not enough to justify a branchy
  env-only path. A later guarded bonus sampler is intentionally narrower:
  `enqueueSampleProcessedLogitsF32DeviceIfSpeculativeBatchNeedsBonus()` keeps
  the vLLM-style processed-logit GPU path, runs on the explicit capture stream,
  and only writes the bonus token when the speculative batch actually reaches
  the all-accepted bonus row. Focused CUDA/ROCm graph-capture regressions pass,
  and `20260613T_phase10_lazy_bonus_moe_stochastic` shows CUDA MoE stochastic
  d3 at 133.8 tok/s (0.96x) and ROCm d3 at 70.9 tok/s (0.92x). This is kept as
  a cleanup and modest ROCm d3 improvement, but it does not close Phase 10.
- Phase 10 now exposes resident sidecar-token and pending-condition counters in
  the iteration matrix. The unsafe shared top-k partial scratch between
  target/verifier and MTP-draft stochastic distribution builders was split into
  arena-owned target and draft buffers and guarded by
  `V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy`. This is a real graph-capture hygiene
  fix, but it did not close the ROCm MoE stochastic blocker:
  `20260614T014124Z-phase10-rocm-moe-d3-split-topk-scratch` still shows ROCm
  fixed d3 at 38.4 tok/s vs 73.7 baseline with only 15.1% acceptance. A
  graph-timing attribution run of the same lane reports much higher acceptance,
  so the next target is the all-position verifier graph/state handoff whose
  correctness changes when GPU-stage timing inserts extra stream ordering.
- Same-run stochastic accepted-prefix histograms explain why this is primarily
  a ROCm MoE target today. CUDA fixed d3 accepts all three drafts in about 54%
  of verifier steps and averages about 2.09 accepted drafts, so eager batched
  target distributions remain reasonable. ROCm fixed d3 rejects at prefix 0 in
  about 65% of verifier steps and averages about 0.51 accepted drafts, so it
  frequently pays for target rows and a bonus row that cannot be consumed.
- A longer greedy capture-amortization check
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260612T_moe_gpu_greedy_long256_capture_check/`
  shows first-use graph economics are part, but not all, of CUDA MoE's weak
  speedup. CUDA fixed d3 improves to 170.7 tok/s vs 146.7 baseline (1.16x) at
  256 decode tokens, compared with 1.05x in the decode-64 matrix. ROCm fixed d3
  is 96.2 tok/s vs 79.4 baseline (1.21x). This keeps both GPU MoE greedy lanes
  below the dense-class target and confirms that the next accepted win must
  reduce steady-state verifier/condition work, not merely hide capture warmup.
- `scripts/run_mtp_iteration_benchmark_matrix.sh` now has `--decode-tokens N`
  for bounded all-device iteration sweeps. The default remains the full
  benchmark decode length.
- The matrix runner now hard-fails dynamic-depth evidence without same-run
  `baseline,fixed_d1,fixed_d2,fixed_d3` neighbors unless
  `--allow-partial-variants` is explicitly set for local diagnostics.
- Bounded MoE iteration matrix covers CUDA/ROCm/CPU, greedy/stochastic,
  baseline, fixed d1/d2/d3, and dynamic at 16 decode tokens. Latest full matrix
  is `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260609T061226Z-iteration-matrix-6753b5e7/`.
  All lanes are functionally green, including CUDA and ROCm stochastic. Every
  MoE MTP lane is still speed-negative against its same-run baseline. Best
  bounded greedy lanes are CUDA d3 69.5 vs 109.8 tok/s, ROCm d3 41.4 vs 64.7
  tok/s, and CPU d3 12.7 vs 17.9 tok/s. Best bounded stochastic lanes are CUDA
  dynamic 53.4 vs 109.7 tok/s, ROCm dynamic 30.6 vs 64.2 tok/s, and CPU d3 12.5
  vs 17.5 tok/s.
- The dead verifier-row publication hooks and tests were removed.

Open gaps:

- Full default-length CPU dense and CPU MoE matrix refreshes remain slow
  acceptance work. Bounded CPU dense and MoE have previous evidence, but fresh
  all-in-one iteration runs now split CPU out because a single `cpu:0` dense
  baseline can take about five minutes even at 16 decode tokens.
- CPU stochastic accepted-count publication is now implemented and
  correctness-gated, but benchmark acceptance is still open. The parity stats
  showed real CPU overhead in the publication path, including hybrid checkpoint
  export, accepted-state publication, and host sampler work. The first
  parallelization pass and top-k sampler fast path have landed, but latest
  bounded benchmark evidence is still speed-negative until refreshed after
  these changes.
- CPU dynamic dense greedy is not controller-overhead bound. In the latest
  bounded matrix, dynamic behaves like fixed d2 at 5.6 tok/s while fixed d3 hits
  9.1 tok/s; the dynamic perfstats show about 4.26s verifier time, 1.51s
  condition-forward time, and 0.51s accepted-state publication time over the
  16-token lane.
- A focused CPU dense dynamic profiler pass
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260609T122350Z-cpu-dense-dynamic-verifier-profile/`
  confirms the verifier cost is model math, not controller or executor spin:
  dynamic landed at 6.56 tok/s with 4.20s verifier, 1.48s condition-forward,
  and 56.8ms publication. Host executor decode stage time was led by
  `GEMM_FUSED_GATE_UP` 30.7%, `GEMM` 27.2%, `GDN_PROJECTION` 13.9%, and
  `LM_HEAD` 12.2%. This is still less vLLM-shaped than desired because CPU
  stochastic evidence is stepwise and CPU greedy still pays a full all-position
  target forward plus batched all-position LM-head rows for verification.
- GDN/short-conv speculative-slot publication is available through verifier row
  capture hooks and is now used by the CPU/CUDA/ROCm all-position publication
  path; broader benchmark evidence still needs to catch up.
- CUDA/ROCm/CPU MoE bounded matrices are functionally green for greedy and
  stochastic, but MTP is speed-negative everywhere. The common blocker is true
  verifier/catch-up cost. Latest fixed d3 MoE greedy spends about 379 ms total
  verifier time plus 220 ms condition-forward time on CUDA, and 659 ms verifier
  plus 346 ms condition-forward time on ROCm, while correction replay remains
  0 ms. Dynamic depth is now stable across d0/d1/d2 transitions but still needs
  better short-run promotion and stochastic depth selection.
- Reusing the ordinary main-decode capture across rejected-state publication by
  merely restamping the live epoch was tested and rejected: focused parity was
  too weak to catch it, but the release MoE benchmark acceptance collapsed.
  Keep the correction boundary recapture until a stronger backend state-refresh
  contract exists.
- CPU vLLM-style state publication is implemented for the current stochastic
  SingleDevice contract but not yet benchmark-accepted.
- CPU MoE commit-replay verification now restores the post-condition
  verifier-base checkpoint. The focused CPU parity regression also proves the
  main all-position verifier rows match serial decode rows, including shifted
  cache preconditioning. The slow CPU serial LM-head verifier helper was removed
  after the batched NativeVNNI all-position path matched serial decode rows, so
  future failures should be treated as real state or publication drift rather
  than a checker-base artifact.
- Phase 3 row-indexed verifier work is accepted for dense SingleDevice:
  `HiddenStateRowsSelectStage` packs a fixed small row set into compact
  `[rows, d_model]` scratch, Qwen forward graphs can feed that scratch to one
  batched LM head, and `OrchestrationRunner` enables the row count around the
  all-position verifier. CPU copies compact rows; CUDA/ROCm use explicit-stream
  graph-workspace row-index arrays with captured replay support. The
  `HiddenStateRowsSelectStage` GPU direct-tensor path now hard-fails unless the
  caller already prepared device pointers, keeping new production tensor
  movement out of `ensureOnDevice()`. Focused slice gate passed:
  `V2_Unit_MTPGraphConstruction`, `V2_Unit_HiddenStateRowSelectStage`,
  `V2_Unit_ForwardExecutionEngineAdvanced`,
  `V2_Integration_CUDAHiddenStateRowSelectStage`, and
  `V2_Integration_ROCmHiddenStateRowSelectStage`. Dense Qwen3.6
  CPU/CUDA/ROCm fixed depth-3 greedy and stochastic verifier parity also pass
  on the row-indexed path. The accepted full bounded matrix
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260609T-phase3-row-indexed-accepted-matrix/`
  covers CUDA/ROCm/CPU, dense/MoE, greedy/stochastic, baseline plus fixed
  d1/d2/d3 and dynamic, with perfstats enabled. Dense greedy is speed-positive
  on all three backends: CUDA best d1 60.9 vs 44.6 tok/s, ROCm best d1 45.7
  vs 31.3 tok/s, and CPU best d3 9.3 vs 4.7 tok/s. Dense stochastic remains
  policy-sensitive and MoE remains speed-negative, so Phase 3 is accepted for
  dense SingleDevice row-indexed verifier correctness/perf only; MoE tuning
  moves to the next slice.
  `MTPSpecDecodeVerifierInputPlan` now names the current single-request
  verifier input and compact-row layout. `OrchestrationRunner` scopes that plan
  around verifier forwards, `DeviceGraphOrchestrator` uploads its row metadata
  through `MTPSpecDecodeMetadataWorkspaceBinding` on the execution/capture
  stream, and `HiddenStateRowsSelectStage` reads that persistent row buffer
  without stage-local uploads. `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition` now proves the
  verifier plan is installed, consumed, and cleared for the all-position
  publication path, and perfstats expose `verifier_row_metadata_path`. The
  broader MTP unit gate, full `^V2_Unit_` hard commit gate, and required
  Integration/Release builds pass.
- CUDA MoE MTP is still speed-negative and must reduce verifier/catch-up cost
  before acceptance. Stochastic also needs acceptance-policy tuning or depth
  policy integration for the default prompt class.
- CUDA and ROCm dense stochastic MTP now match acceptance under the same seed,
  but the generated token streams still differ at a few real-model samples
  while the real-logit-style sampler fixture passes. This points at full-model
  logits/state/perf differences rather than isolated sampler math.
- Phase 4 sampler-contract and first device-outcome slices are implemented:
  `MTPRejectionSampler` owns threshold-driven stochastic row semantics and a
  backend-neutral batch summary contract. CUDA/ROCm now verify penalty-free
  all-position stochastic rows in one batch, sample the bonus token into an
  arena buffer, and reduce committed output tokens/accepted counts with a tiny
  shared-math summary kernel before copying compact metadata to host. Focused
  MTP unit gate, dense Qwen3.6 CPU/CUDA/ROCm stochastic parity, Integration and
  Release builds pass. Focused benchmark
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260609T-phase4-device-batch-outcome-dense-stochastic/`
  shows CUDA best dynamic 38.4 vs 44.7 baseline and ROCm best d1 24.3 vs 31.4
  baseline; CPU baseline completed but the CPU d1 lane was stopped after
  excessive wall time. This is still not full Phase 4 acceptance: dense
  stochastic remains speed-negative and true GPU-resident sampling still needs
  fewer host round trips plus a speed-positive policy.
- Phase 4 penalty-free stochastic sidecar stream handoff is implemented:
  sidecar logits can remain on the explicit capture/replay stream until compact
  distribution build and device batch-outcome reduction consume them. Penalty
  paths still force the older synchronized contract because sampler history can
  mutate logits. `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition`, the broader MTP unit gate,
  dense Qwen3.6 CPU/CUDA/ROCm stochastic verifier parity, and Integration/Release
  builds passed. Focused CUDA/ROCm dense stochastic benchmark
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260610T-phase4-stochastic-sidecar-stream-handoff/`
  shows the handoff counters active on both backends. CUDA now has a short-run
  stochastic win at fixed d2, 49.5 vs 44.6 tok/s (1.11x), but ROCm remains
  speed-negative, best fixed d2 29.9 vs 31.3 tok/s (0.96x). Perfstats point at
  ROCm stochastic device sampling cost as the next blocker:
  `sample_mtp_token_stochastic_device` is about 4.4 ms/sample on ROCm versus
  about 1.0 ms/sample on CUDA in this lane. A fused first-token direct sampler
  experiment was benchmark-rejected and removed; remaining Phase 4 work is
  ROCm sampler tuning plus true device-resident draft/decision plumbing, not
  another first-token sampler variant.
- Trusted compact stochastic result reads now use the backend fast D2H path for
  orchestrator-owned scratch. The MTP unit gate plus dense Qwen3.6 CPU/CUDA/ROCm
  stochastic verifier parity passed, and focused benchmark
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260610T-phase4-stochastic-fast-d2h/`
  shows this was hygiene rather than the missing speedup: CUDA best fixed d2 is
  49.8 vs 44.6 tok/s (1.12x), while ROCm best fixed d2 is 29.2 vs 31.4 tok/s
  (0.93x) and `sample_mtp_token_stochastic_device` remains about 4.4-4.6
  ms/sample. The next accepted Phase 4 slice should promote draft tokens,
  target rows, and verifier bonus metadata to persistent device buffers so MTP
  does not D2H a sampled draft token between sidecar steps or before verifier
  input planning.
- Device-token batch verification and device-resident sidecar token input are
  now implemented for penalty-free CUDA/ROCm stochastic rows. Draft sample
  tokens are written into arena buffers, verifier batches consume those device
  tokens directly, and chained sidecar rows copy the prior sampled token into a
  stable arena-owned `MTP_CONDITION_TOKEN` on the explicit sidecar stream.
  ROCm gained the missing non-synchronizing `deviceCopyAsync()` backend hook
  after the first benchmark exposed a hard failure in fixed d2. Focused
  `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition`, broader MTP unit gate,
  `V2_Integration_GPUSamplingKernels`, and dense Qwen3.6 CPU/CUDA/ROCm
  stochastic parity passed. Focused benchmark
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260610T-phase4-stochastic-device-sidecar-token-input-fixed/`
  shows CUDA fixed d2 at 46.6 vs 44.7 tok/s (1.04x) and ROCm fixed d2 at
  29.8 vs 31.3 tok/s (0.95x). Follow-up ROCm attribution
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260610T-phase4-rocm-stochastic-sample-sync-attribution/`
  shows sampler enqueue is cheap, about 0.003 ms/sample, while the compact
  result D2H/sync costs 2.9-4.7 ms/sample because it drains deferred
  verifier/sidecar work at the host read boundary. The next Phase 4 target is
  device-resident verifier input and metadata rather than more top-k kernel
  tuning. The generic forward graph contract now carries stable device token
  IDs, Qwen embedding graphs pass the pointer through, forward-cache signatures
  distinguish host-token and device-token sources, and focused
  `V2_Unit_IGraphBuilder`, `V2_Unit_ForwardGraphTypes`, and
  `V2_Unit_ForwardExecutionEngine` pass for that slice. The target verifier
  can now compose `[first_token, draft_0, ...]` into arena-owned
  `MTP_VERIFIER_INPUT_TOKENS` on the same explicit stream used for verifier
  graph replay, then call `forwardWithDeviceTokenIds()` with the host token row
  retained only as metadata shadow. Focused
  `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition`, `V2_Unit_IGraphBuilder`,
  `V2_Unit_ForwardGraphTypes`, and `V2_Unit_ForwardExecutionEngine` pass for
  the verifier-input slice. Deferred draft-token host reads are now implemented
  for penalty-free GPU stochastic rows and guarded by explicit sample-ready
  events. Chained sidecars, verifier token input staging, and the batched
  stochastic verifier wait on those events instead of relying on the old scalar
  D2H read as an accidental synchronization point. Focused
  `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition`,
  `V2_Integration_GPUSamplingKernels`,
  `V2_Integration_PrefixCacheMTP_Qwen36ROCmGpuGraphsStochasticSmoke`, and
  `V2_Integration_Parity_Qwen36_ROCm_SingleDevice_Qwen36ROCmSingleDevicePrefixMTPParity_MTPStochasticSamplingVerifierRuns`
  pass. Focused ROCm benchmark
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260610T-phase4-deferred-draft-host-read-ordered/`
  restores plausible acceptance and removes draft sample D2H, but fixed d2 is
  still speed-negative at 26.8 vs 31.2 tok/s; target sampling still performs a
  compact D2H at about 2.86 ms/read and verifier forward averages about
  22.7 ms/run. Later Phase 4 slices removed the token-D2H boundary and moved
  the remaining compact outcome/publication cost into the Phase 5/6 state-slot
  work.
- Penalty-free stochastic all-position verification now repairs the first
  shifted MTP KV row from the device-resident target sample when the host token
  is intentionally deferred. `HiddenStateRowSelectStage` and
  `HiddenStateRowsSelectStage` replay mutators are host-intent-only: they never
  dereference stale workspace bindings or upload GPU metadata before
  executor-owned workspace/stream binding. Graph launch preparation now uploads
  dirty row metadata through a typed `prepareGraphLaunch()` hook after the
  executor has rebound the current workspace and explicit stream, and the
  CUDA/ROCm row-select integrations exercise that contract without recapture.
  CUDA and ROCm embedding validation readbacks are skipped during graph capture
  because D2H plus stream sync is capture-illegal; ordinary validation still
  checks device token IDs outside capture. Focused gates passed:
  post-relink MTP unit gate,
  `V2_Unit_ForwardGraphTypes`,
  `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition`,
  `V2_Unit_HiddenStateRowSelectStage`,
  `V2_Unit_PrefillGraphCaptureDynamicParams`,
  CUDA/ROCm `HiddenStateRowSelectStage`,
  `V2_Integration_GPUSamplingKernels`, and CUDA/ROCm
  `Qwen36*GpuGraphsStochasticSmoke`.
- The first target token can now stay device-resident through the first MTP
  sidecar, verifier-input composition, and batched stochastic summary on
  CUDA/ROCm. Target and draft sampled-token slots use explicit sample-ready
  events, the sidecar consumes the target sample through
  `forwardMTPFromDeviceTargetForDeviceSampling()`, and the summary reducer can
  read the first token from device memory instead of a host scalar. Focused
  `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition`,
  `V2_Integration_GPUSamplingKernels`,
  `V2_Integration_PrefixCacheMTP_Qwen36ROCmGpuGraphsStochasticSmoke`, and
  `V2_Integration_Parity_Qwen36_ROCm_SingleDevice_Qwen36ROCmSingleDevicePrefixMTPParity_MTPStochasticSamplingVerifierRuns`
  pass. Focused ROCm benchmark
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260610T-phase4-device-first-target-summary/`
  shows 15 deferred first-token reads, 15 device-first batch summaries, target
  sample ready events/waits, and only one remaining target-slot D2H sync for
  the final/budget-limited step. Fixed d2 is still speed-negative at 26.97 vs
  31.25 tok/s, so the next Phase 4 blocker has moved to shifted-prefill,
  condition-forward, and verifier-forward host-wall cost rather than token
  scalar D2H. The post-rebuild Phase 4 gate passed `^V2_Unit_` 500/500 plus
  focused ROCm stochastic parity, ROCm stochastic graph smoke, and CUDA/ROCm
  GPU sampling integrations.
- `clearCache()` now treats adaptive MTP depth as request-scoped state. The
  prior behavior preserved learned depth across benchmark iterations while
  resetting MTP counters, producing inconsistent summaries such as
  `current_depth=2` with `updates=0`. Focused
  `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition` passes after updating the regression. The
  follow-up ROCm stochastic reset check
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260610T-phase4-rocm-dense-stochastic-dynamic-reset-check/`
  shows cold-request dynamic still trails baseline, 27.36 vs 30.74 tok/s,
  while follow-up policy probes rejected aggressive controller-only tuning:
  d1->d0 churn fell to 23.52 tok/s, optimistic d3 start reached 25.29-26.79
  tok/s, and a same-build fixed d3 control reached 28.33 tok/s. The standard
  matrix runner now keeps dynamic depth on a d1 floor; depth-zero bypass is a
  diagnostic/experimental lane until it is faster than d1. The accepted focused
  ROCm stochastic lane
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260610T-phase4-rocm-dense-stochastic-fixed-dynamic-floor1/`
  shows baseline 30.68 tok/s, fixed d1 31.88, fixed d2 26.01, fixed d3 29.64,
  and dynamic 31.78 with 75% acceptance and no depth churn.
- Main-decode stream handoff now covers MTP condition forward, MTP depth-zero
  direct state advance, and ordinary GPU decode sampling. The forward engine
  reports actual deferred final-sync events and publishes the capture stream
  only to the immediate GPU sampler/distribution consumer. Focused units plus
  ROCm stochastic parity/smoke pass. The perfstats confirm `main_decode`
  replay syncs are gone on the corrected ROCm dynamic lane; the remaining
  shifted-prefill, sequential shifted-row commit, verifier, and
  condition-forward costs became the concrete follow-up tuning targets.
- Pending logits stream handoff is now structurally owned by private role
  slots (`MTPSidecar`, `MainDecode`, `AllPositionVerifier`) instead of raw
  nullable fields. The stream pointer is private to a one-shot handoff object:
  producers may republish the same explicit stream after an in-place logits
  mutation, but replacing an unconsumed handoff with a different stream is a
  hard logic error. The source hygiene unit strips comments/strings and fails
  if production code accesses the slot table or reintroduces a raw mutable
  slot-reference helper. The post-relink focused gate passed
  `V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy`, row-select/graph-launch units, CUDA
  and ROCm row-select integrations, GPU sampler integration, and CUDA/ROCm
  Qwen3.6 stochastic graph smokes. `V2_Unit_DeviceGraphOrchestrator` now also
  covers the runtime one-shot rule through the public host interface: same
  stream republish is allowed, different unconsumed stream overwrite throws,
  explicit clear and `clear_cache()` reset ownership, and verifier/main roles
  are independent.
- Correction-replay publication reset now returns a typed
  `ReplayStateResetSummary` and exports cache-class counts in the
  `live_prefix_replay_state_after_mutation` perf record. Focused
  `V2_Unit_ForwardExecutionEngine` coverage proves ordinary decode cache
  identities are reset while all-position verifier identities are preserved for
  explicit-stream rebind. `scripts/summarize_mtp_perfstats.py` and the matrix
  TSV now surface reset-cache, stream-rebind, ordinary-decode, verifier, and
  other-cache counts for each benchmark lane. The next telemetry slice added
  decode-only sidecar, shifted-row, stochastic sampling, checkpoint, and
  sidecar graph hit/miss columns so ROCm/CUDA tuning can distinguish verifier
  cost from shifted-cache maintenance. The script unit, shell syntax check, a
  one-row baseline TSV sanity check, and an extended ROCm dense d1 field-count
  smoke pass.
- The long ROCm stochastic clear-cache repeatability regression split the state
  problem into two boundaries. Dense sidecar execution can now advertise
  `supportsMTPSidecarPreservesMainState()` and skip the verifier-base restore,
  after the preservation checker was corrected to compare against the
  post-condition verifier-base checkpoint. Accepted-state publication, however,
  is still a hard live-state mutation and now always resets GPU replay state.
  The previous accept-all replay preservation changed ROCm stochastic
  trajectories after `clearCache()`. A source hygiene guard locks the replay
  reset in `publishAcceptedMTPSpecState()`, and the focused gate passes:
  `V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy`,
  `V2_Integration_Parity_Qwen36_ROCm_SingleDevice_Qwen36ROCmSingleDevicePrefixMTPParity_MTPStochasticSamplingVerifierRuns`,
  `V2_Integration_PrefixCacheMTP_Qwen36ROCmGpuGraphsStochasticSmoke`,
  `V2_Integration_PrefixCacheMTP_Qwen36ROCmGpuGraphsStochasticClearCacheRepeatabilityLong`,
  and `V2_Integration_GPUSamplingKernels`. The short CUDA/ROCm stochastic
  smokes now set `LLAMINAR_DETERMINISTIC` before asserting token equality; a
  Qwen3.6 top-k=20 repeated graph-replay sampler regression rules out compact
  sampler drift, while non-deterministic fast-path near-ties remain a benchmark
  signal rather than a repeatability assertion.
- KV-only MTP sidecar replay now has its own event-backed shifted-MTP-KV
  handoff instead of borrowing the pending-logits stream marker. The old
  ownership mix skipped both explicit stream sync and shifted-KV readiness
  events for segmented KV-only replay. The source hygiene unit now enforces
  that KV-only sidecars do not call the deferred sampling/logits handoff, and
  that accepted-state publication waits before touching shifted MTP KV. Focused
  units, CUDA/ROCm stochastic graph smokes, GPU sampler integration, and the
  release relink pass. Refreshed ROCm dense stochastic focused matrix
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260610T-focused-rocm-dense-stochastic-dynamic-shifted-kv-shape-fixed/`
  shows baseline 32.55 tok/s, fixed d1 34.39, fixed d2 29.83, fixed d3 24.34,
  and dynamic 34.49 after one promotion. Follow-up condition telemetry and
  dynamic-depth tuning culminated in
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260610T-focused-rocm-dense-stochastic-long64-depth-explore/`:
  baseline 30.37 tok/s, fixed d1 32.35, fixed d2 29.11, fixed d3 33.66, and
  dynamic 30.84. Dynamic now reaches d3 through d1 floor promotion plus
  `probe_higher_before_demote`, but it still trails fixed d3 because verifier
  and rejection-driven condition-forward cost dominate; sampling remains below
  13 ms/request. The added main-decode replay telemetry first showed the
  dynamic condition path did 28 warmups, 1 capture, and 0 replay, so ordinary
  decode replay preservation/rebinding after spec-state publication became
  the next concrete speed target. That slice is now implemented:
  `ForwardReplayStateCacheClass::SingleTokenOrdinaryDecode` keeps one-token
  condition/decode captures alive across MTP accepted-state publication by
  marking them dirty for explicit-stream rebind and stamping them with the new
  live replay-state epoch. Focused real-model telemetry in
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260610T-focused-rocm-dense-stochastic-long64-ordinary-replay-preserve/`
  moved the dynamic condition path to 4 warmups, 4 captures, and 65 replays,
  with `replay_ordinary_decode_resets=0`, zero transaction validation failures,
  and zero rollbacks. The next accepted slice reuses the first shifted MTP KV
  row appended by main-state-preserving sidecars instead of truncating it away
  and rerunning a KV-only depth-0 sidecar. Focused
  `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition` coverage proves all-position publication
  reuses that first row while still sequentially committing rejected correction
  rows, and the matrix schema now reports `shifted_initial_commits` plus
  `shifted_initial_reused`. Real-model ROCm telemetry in
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260610T-focused-rocm-dense-stochastic-long64-shifted-first-reuse/`
  shows `shifted_initial_commits=0`, reused sidecar rows on every MTP lane,
  dynamic `shifted_row_ms` dropping from about 1006 ms to about 102 ms, zero
  transaction validation failures, and zero rollbacks. Controller probes then
  tightened `probe_higher_before_demote`, floor-promotion thresholds, and
  rejected-depth hysteresis while benchmark-rejecting early bad-probe aborts
  and stricter perfect-floor hysteresis.
- Phase 4 dense SingleDevice closeout is accepted. The final slice split
  first-sidecar host-token and device-token graph caches, preserved sidecar
  replay state across accepted-state publication, and added a GPU regression for
  alternating host/device first-sidecar calls. The focused gate passed
  `V2_Unit_MTPRejectionSampler`, `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition`,
  `V2_Unit_MTPGraphConstruction`, `V2_Unit_DeviceGraphOrchestrator`,
  `V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy`, `V2_Integration_GPUSamplingKernels`,
  dense Qwen3.6 stochastic parity on CPU/CUDA/ROCm, and CUDA/ROCm stochastic
  graph smokes. The closeout matrix
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260610T-phase4-dense-stochastic-closeout-matrix-v2/`
  shows useful speed-positive stochastic lanes on every backend: CUDA fixed d3
  59.44 vs 43.88 tok/s, ROCm fixed d1 33.48 and dynamic 32.57 vs 30.33 tok/s,
  and CPU fixed d2 5.78 vs 4.46 tok/s. ROCm fixed d2/d3 are documented
  acceptance-limited, not contract failures.
- Phase 5 has started with a typed live-state mutation ledger. Runtime probes
  and perf tags now distinguish accepted publication, rejected correction,
  prefix restore, prefix truncate, and session reset; `clear_cache()` and
  `clearInferenceState()` both advance the live-state epoch. The runner also
  skips the post-condition verifier-base checkpoint export on the all-position
  publication path when the sidecar is main-state preserving and debug replay
  checks are off. The second focused slice moved that synthetic verifier-base
  stamp into `makeLogicalMTPVerifierBaseSnapshot()`, making the checkpoint-free
  path a tested MTP transaction primitive instead of an inline runner detail.
  `V2_Unit_MTPStateTransaction` now proves the logical stamp carries
  decode-equivalent main/shifted-KV token counts and no payload blocks.
  `V2_Unit_MTPGraphConstruction` also proves accepted publication and rejected
  correction update distinct live-state mutation reasons while preserving the
  sidecar-owned first shifted-KV row contract. The benchmark summary pipeline
  now reports `publish_count` and `publish_avg_ms` beside `publish_ms`, so the
  Phase 5 closeout matrix can judge publication stability across d1/d2/d3
  instead of comparing only total wall time. A bounded dense stochastic
  publication-cost slice is green on CUDA/ROCm with 16 decode tokens and CPU
  with 8 decode tokens:
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260610T-phase5-publication-cost-dense-stochastic-gpu/`
  and `...-cpu8/`. Publish cost is stable across d1/d2/d3: CUDA
  0.47-0.56 ms/publish, ROCm 0.29-0.32 ms/publish, and CPU
  3.84-3.86 ms/publish. Checkpoint export still appears as debug/prefix
  anchoring cost, but the steady slot-publication path is no longer scaling
  with depth. The next slice added a forced-reject replay oracle for the no
  ready-token case: under `LLAMINAR_MTP_VERIFY_COMMIT_REPLAY_CHECK`, the
  all-position publication path now derives the next token by forwarding the
  rejected correction from the committed state, then compares that token and
  continuation against a full replay from the verifier base. The
  `AllPositionSpecPublicationForcedRejectReplayCheckDerivesNextToken` unit
  proves the next one-token decode consumes the rejected correction exactly
  once. The final cleanup slice removed the stale all-position
  `discarded_sidecar_checkpoint` tag; that tag remains only on the sequential
  verifier path where a post-sidecar checkpoint is still a real object.
  Phase 5 is accepted on the focused gate.
- Server E2E repair: CPU NodeLocal MTP thinking-budget requests no longer hang.
  Rank 0 now sends the per-step decode token budget with `DECODE_STEP`, worker
  ranks reset that budget after the step, and an MPI sidecar boundary fence keeps
  sidecar/verifier collectives ordered across ranks. The launcher also maps CPU
  NodeLocal ranks with `--bind-to core --map-by socket:PE=<cores/socket>`.
  Gates: `V2_Unit_MPIBootstrap`, `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition`, focused CPU
  MTP thinking E2E `27/27`, and dense Qwen3.6 baseline/prefix/MTP E2E `261/261`
  on CPU/CUDA/ROCm.
- TP/PP/ExpertParallel MTP is out of scope until SingleDevice is green.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Freeze The Spec Transaction Contract

Goal: make one transaction object describe every speculative step.

Work:

- Promote `MTPSpecStepPlan`, `MTPSpecDecodeMetadata`, accepted-count planning,
  and publication provenance into the only legal interface between
  `OrchestrationRunner` and backend publication.
- Add `MTPSpecPersistentMetadata` and a CPU reference implementation with the
  same shape as the GPU buffers.
- Encode target rows, bonus rows, accepted counts, rejected/correction rows,
  state-slot indices, and stop/EOS behavior in metadata rather than side
  channels.
- Move dynamic-depth observations to consume transaction outputs only.

Status:

- Accepted. The runner now drives speculative decode through
  `MTPSpecDecodeTransaction`, `MTPSpecStepPlan`, and
  `MTPSpecStateContract` instead of backend-local side channels. Focused
  coverage includes `V2_Unit_MTPIterationBenchmarkMatrix`,
  `V2_Unit_MTPSpecDecodeMetadata`, `V2_Unit_MTPSpecDecodeTransaction`,
  `V2_Unit_MTPDecodeCatchup`, `V2_Unit_MTPVerifierPolicy`, and
  `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition`. Dynamic-depth accounting consumes
  accepted/rejected/rollback transaction outputs rather than raw runner
  mutations.

Exit gate:

- Unit tests cover accept-all, reject-first, reject-after-prefix, bonus-ready,
  stop/EOS, prefix restore, stochastic residual, and budget-limited d0/d1 cases
  without invoking a model runner.
- Runner tests fail if a path commits tokens or state without a transaction.

### Phase 2: Persistent Metadata Buffers And Spec Slots

Goal: match vLLM's padded persistent metadata/state-buffer shape.

Work:

- Add per-backend persistent buffers for draft tokens, positions, query starts,
  target/bonus logit indices, draft probabilities, random uniforms, accepted
  counts, and GDN/short-conv/KV state-slot indices.
- GPU buffers must be declared through workspace/arena consumers and updated on
  explicit streams. CPU buffers use the same layout and can be parallel-filled.
- Replace request-local vectors in hot verifier paths with views into these
  buffers.
- Add diagnostics showing whether a lane used persistent metadata or a
  compatibility vector path.

Status:

- Accepted. Persistent metadata/workspace bindings exist for the verifier and
  sampler hot paths, including draft tokens, verifier-row positions, sampled
  device-token slots, stochastic draft sample probabilities, and accepted-count
  publication plans. GPU paths declare scratch through arena/workspace
  consumers and hard-fail missing explicit streams; CPU uses the same logical
  layout through host-side metadata. Focused coverage includes
  `V2_Unit_MTPSpecDecodeMetadata`, `V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy`,
  `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition`, `V2_Integration_GPUSamplingKernels`, and
  the static hygiene guards for default streams and ad-hoc ROCm hot-path
  allocations.

Exit gate:

- CPU/CUDA/ROCm unit tests prove identical metadata layout for fixed d1/d2/d3,
  dynamic d0 probes, and stochastic rows.
- Perfstats show zero hot-path ad-hoc GPU allocations and no implicit-stream
  operations.

### Phase 3: Row-Indexed Target Verifier Graph

Goal: keep the target verifier as one `draft_count + 1` forward but avoid
unnecessary all-position work.

Work:

- Build verifier graph inputs from persistent metadata, not temporary vectors.
- Add row-indexed LM-head/logits production for target rows and bonus rows.
  The initial Qwen graph wiring is complete for a fixed compact row count, with
  cache-key protection for different compact depths. The current single-request
  verifier row layout is now named through `MTPSpecDecodeVerifierInputPlan`.
  `HiddenStateRowsSelectStage` consumes caller-owned device row metadata from
  `MTPSpecDecodeMetadataWorkspaceBinding`; GPU uploads happen on the same
  explicit stream as verifier graph execution. Full all-position LM head remains
  only as a guarded compatibility mode until benchmark acceptance is proven.
- Preserve verifier graph capture/replay across accept-all steps and recapture
  only when a true state-boundary invalidation occurs.
- Add CPU stage attribution for verifier rows so regressions can identify
  GEMM/GDN/LM-head cost by phase. Row metadata path diagnostics are in place;
  stage-level CPU attribution remains to be expanded if CPU verifier cost
  regresses again.

Exit gate:

- Accepted for dense SingleDevice as of
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260609T-phase3-row-indexed-accepted-matrix/`.
  Dense CPU/CUDA/ROCm greedy and stochastic parity pass with row-indexed
  verifier logits; dense greedy benchmarks are speed-positive on all three
  backends.
- Remaining follow-up: keep the compatibility all-position verifier mode
  guarded until the next CI cleanup slice removes dead verifier paths.

### Phase 4: Batched Greedy/Stochastic Rejection Sampler

Goal: replace stepwise stochastic verification with a vLLM-shaped batched
sampler.

Work:

- Implement a shared rejection-sampling interface over flattened target logits,
  draft probabilities, draft tokens, and random thresholds.
  First slice complete: `MTPRejectionSampler` defines the distribution-row
  contract and all-position stochastic catch-up construction for the current
  SingleDevice path.
- Phase 4 follow-up for MoE performance: replace the compact-table stochastic
  verifier with the vLLM worker-style full-logit path. The focused
  `V2_Perf_GPUSpeculativeSummary.StochasticLazyTargetQwen36Rows` trial rejected
  two shortcuts: single-block lazy full-logit verification is far slower than
  compact tables on CUDA/ROCm, and conditional bonus sampling does not beat the
  current compact batch. Both rejected prototypes and their tests were removed
  after focused rebuild, integration, and perf-smoke guards passed. The
  accepted design now needs
  full-vocab block stats over target/draft logits, accepted-count reduction
  from draft-token probability lookups, and one-row rejected/bonus resampling.
  Shared slices complete: `MTPRejectionSampler` now has processed full-logit
  row stats, probability lookup, residual sampling, bonus sampling, and
  batch/catch-up helpers with focused `V2_Unit_MTPRejectionSampler` coverage.
  CUDA/ROCm expose graph-capturable processed-logit row verifier and bonus
  sampler kernels that match the CPU reference, reject null/default streams,
  and are covered by the verifier+bonus+summary mini-transaction in
  `V2_Integration_GPUSamplingKernels`. The direct full-vocab perf lane
  `V2_Perf_GPUSpeculativeSummary.StochasticProcessedLogitQwen36Rows` now
  exists. The first optimization slice made processed-logit verification
  row-parallel, one block per verifier row, instead of serializing rows inside
  one block. Focused correctness still passes, and release smoke now shows
  CUDA reject/all-accept cases at about 1.00/1.25 ms and ROCm at about
  2.58/2.57 ms for three verifier rows. This is correct and graph-capturable,
  but not production-promoted until the next optimization slice reduces the
  remaining full-vocab stochastic verifier cost. The next accepted slice adds
  an optional device draft-token-probability vector to the processed-logit
  verifier, matching the vLLM worker idea that the sampled draft row already
  knows `q(sampled_token)`. CUDA/ROCm now skip draft full-row stats on accepted
  rows and compute them only when residual sampling is needed after a
  rejection. Focused guards passed:
  `V2_Unit_MTPRejectionSampler|V2_Integration_GPUSamplingKernels`, and release
  `StochasticProcessedLogitQwen36Rows` reports CUDA reject/prefix1/all-accept
  0.98/0.95/0.65 ms and ROCm 2.47/2.48/1.81 ms for three Qwen3.6-sized rows.
  Follow-up plumbing complete: compact device draft sampling can now write
  `p(sampled_draft_token)` into arena-owned `STOCHASTIC_DRAFT_SAMPLE_PROBS`
  without an extra kernel or sync. The shared CPU/CUDA/ROCm sampling helper
  reports the selected probability, CUDA/ROCm graph-captured sampler tests
  prove it on Qwen3.6 top-k/top-p rows, and
  `V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy` covers the new arena buffer.
  A fused compact target-partials verifier prototype is correct and graph
  capturable, but it is not an accepted MoE performance path: focused Release
  perf shows only noise-level CUDA movement and a clear ROCm regression
  (rows 1/2/3 compact about 5129/5792/6520 us versus fused about
  6238/6884/7597 us). Do not wire this compact fusion into production. The
  processed-logit top-k/top-p warper slice is now implemented and correct for
  CUDA/ROCm: it builds full processed-logit rows from raw Qwen3.6-sized logits,
  preserves compact top-k/top-p probability semantics, rejects null/default
  streams, graph-captures with processed-logit sampling, and can publish the
  sampled-token probability. The regression
  `TopKTopPProcessedLogits_Qwen36VocabTopK40_MatchesCPUAndCaptures` covers the
  large-vocab, top-k=40, top-p=0.95, temperature=0.6 path on both GPU backends.
  Focused guards passed:
  `V2_Unit_MTPRejectionSampler|V2_Integration_GPUSamplingKernels` and release
  `V2_Perf_GPUSpeculativeSummary`. Production wiring is now aligned with the
  vLLM worker contract instead of the earlier compact-table shortcut:
  GPU runners build processed target logits on the explicit verifier stream,
  consume sampled draft tokens from device slots, and run the batched outcome
  verifier with `no_draft_probabilities=true` so `q` is one-hot. Penalty-free
  and history-dependent penalty rows use the batched verifier; penalty rows
  first apply their deterministic vLLM speculative branch history.
  Host-visible sampled tokens keep their device sample-slot readiness edge, so
  the batch verifier still consumes device draft-token slots. Focused runner
  units, GPU sampler capture, and Qwen3.6 CUDA/ROCm dense+MoE stochastic parity
  pass. The final cleanup removed the hidden full target/draft probability arena
  rows and scalar probability-row verifier from production GPU runners; new
  tuning should reduce verifier/condition economics rather than returning to
  full-probability or compact-table dead ends.
  A fused prefix-stop verifier experiment was benchmark-rejected and removed:
  it only modestly helped ROCm reject-at-0 and was worse for
  prefix-1/all-accepted cases, so it is not an accepted path.
- GPU kernels produce output tokens plus `num_accepted_tokens` without CPU
  participation. CPU uses scalar/AVX2/AVX512 dispatch plus OpenMP where useful.
  First GPU step complete for penalty-free SingleDevice all-position verifier:
  runner batches stochastic row verification through the existing device batch
  kernel, samples the bonus token into a device arena buffer, and summarizes
  output tokens plus accepted counts through a CUDA/ROCm shared-math reduction
  kernel. The penalty-free CUDA/ROCm lane now also defers verifier final sync
  into those target distribution and batch-summary kernels, verifies draft rows
  from device token buffers, and chains sidecar inputs from a stable
  device-resident condition-token buffer. Generic forward graphs now accept a
  stable device-token input source, the target verifier input row is composed
  into arena-owned device storage on the graph execution stream, and the first
  target sample can feed both the first sidecar and batched summary without a
  host scalar read. The compact device-batch outcome now lives in the shared
  `MTPRejectionSampler` contract, and the runner no longer passes a host
  draft-token shadow into the outcome verifier; CUDA/ROCm must read sampled
  draft tokens from device slots. Focused sampler, prefill/decode transition,
  DeviceGraphOrchestrator units, GPU sampling integration, and CUDA/ROCm
  stochastic graph smokes cover that boundary. The final Phase 4 closeout slice
  also split host-token and device-token first-sidecar graph caches and
  preserves sidecar replay state across accepted-state publication. Those fixes
  let ROCm sidecar contexts reach capture/replay instead of staying in warmup.
  The accepted dense stochastic matrix
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260610T-phase4-dense-stochastic-closeout-matrix-v2/`
  is speed-positive in useful bounded lanes on all three backends: CUDA fixed d3
  59.44 vs 43.88 tok/s, ROCm fixed d1 33.48 and dynamic 32.57 vs 30.33 tok/s,
  and CPU fixed d2 5.78 vs 4.46 tok/s. ROCm fixed d2/d3 are documented
  acceptance-limited on this prompt, at 28.6% and 46.2% acceptance. The runner
  still receives compact outcome metadata on the host; completing fully
  device-resident publication is Phase 5/6 work, not a Phase 4 blocker.
- Greedy uses the same buffers and output contract, with argmax equality as the
  deterministic accept test.
- Retire decode-equivalent stochastic verifier use from accepted dense
  SingleDevice lanes. The remaining compatibility code is guarded for
  unsupported future topologies/features only and must not fire in the Phase 4
  dense gates.

Exit gate:

- Accepted for dense SingleDevice CPU/CUDA/ROCm as of the closeout gate:
  `V2_Unit_MTPRejectionSampler`, `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition`,
  `V2_Unit_MTPGraphConstruction`, `V2_Unit_DeviceGraphOrchestrator`,
  `V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy`, `V2_Integration_GPUSamplingKernels`,
  dense Qwen3.6 stochastic parity on CPU/CUDA/ROCm, and CUDA/ROCm stochastic
  graph smokes all pass.
- CPU/CUDA/ROCm sampler parity passes on synthetic and Qwen3.6 real-logit-style
  fixtures for greedy, top-k/top-p, temperature, residual sampling, and seeded
  RNG.
- Dense stochastic MTP no longer emits the retired
  `decode_equivalent_stochastic_verifier_runs` counter in accepted lanes; parity
  and prefix-cache MTP probes assert the all-position publication path instead.
- Bounded stochastic dense benchmarks are speed-positive on each backend at
  least one fixed/dynamic lane, with ROCm d2/d3 documented as
  acceptance-limited rather than contract failures.

### Phase 5: Publish From Spec Slots, Not Checkpoints

Goal: make accepted-state publication cheap, atomic, and backend-neutral.

Status:

- Accepted. Focused slices added typed state-version diagnostics and moved
  the all-position verifier-base checkpoint skip behind the tested
  `makeLogicalMTPVerifierBaseSnapshot()` transaction helper. Guarded by
  `V2_Unit_MTPStateTransaction`, `V2_Unit_MTPGraphConstruction`,
  `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition`,
  `V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy`, and the MTP perfstats/matrix script
  unit regressions. The first publication-cost slice shows stable per-publish
  cost across fixed d1/d2/d3 on CUDA, ROCm, and CPU; forced-reject replay is
  covered by a no-ready-token oracle and the stale all-position checkpoint tag
  was removed.

Work:

- Publish KV, shifted MTP KV, GDN recurrence, short-conv state, terminal hidden,
  terminal logits, sampler history, positions, and sequence lengths from
  accepted speculative slots.
- Keep checkpoint export/import only for prefix-cache restore and debug
  verification, not the steady MTP verifier path.
- Add state-version diagnostics that distinguish accepted publication,
  rejected correction, prefix restore, and session reset.
- Ensure CPU publication uses the same slot contract as CUDA/ROCm rather than a
  host-only checkpoint path.

Exit gate:

- Perfstats show publication cost is small and stable across d1/d2/d3 on CPU,
  CUDA, and ROCm.
- Forced reject parity proves the live state equals full replay after the next
  ordinary decode step.
- Dead checkpoint-dependent MTP publication code and tests are removed.

### Phase 6: Graph-Captured Draft/Verify/Sample/Publish

Goal: make the whole SingleDevice MTP step graph-shaped where the backend can
support it.

Status:

- Accepted on 2026-06-10. The dense CUDA/ROCm stochastic graph smokes now assert the actual
  d1 vLLM-style graph lifecycle: `main_verifier`, `mtp_decode_sidecar`, and
  `mtp_decode_catchup` must warm, capture, and replay during graph warmup, then
  replay again after `clearCache()`. The smoke intentionally does not require
  an ordinary `main_decode` replay in this lane because the ready
  prefill/accepted logits feed the target verifier directly. Focused gate:
  `V2_Integration_PrefixCacheMTP_Qwen36ROCmGpuGraphsStochasticSmoke` and
  `V2_Integration_PrefixCacheMTP_Qwen36CUDAGpuGraphsStochasticSmoke` pass.
- ROCm verifier attention now matches CUDA for MTP continuation rows M=2..4.
  The previous ROCm M=2 limit made fixed-depth-3 verification fall through to
  a prefill-shaped path and produce wrong verifier tokens. Focused coverage:
  `V2_Unit_AttentionComputeStage_DynamicKVLen`,
  `FlashDecode_NativeFP16KV_MultiRowContinuationMatchesSerialRows`,
  ROCm/CUDA fixed-depth-3 parity, ROCm/CUDA dynamic parity, and both CUDA/ROCm
  stochastic graph smokes pass.
- CUDA and ROCm greedy graph smokes now use the same benchmark-style
  `prefill()` plus `decodeStep()` path as stochastic MTP and require
  `main_verifier`, `mtp_decode_sidecar`, and `mtp_decode_catchup` to
  warm/capture/replay. Focused gate:
  `V2_Integration_PrefixCacheMTP_Qwen36ROCmGpuGraphsSmoke` and
  `V2_Integration_PrefixCacheMTP_Qwen36CUDAGpuGraphsSmoke` pass.
- CUDA and ROCm stochastic clear-cache repeatability now use a true
  long-context 768-token prompt plus 64 decode tokens, graph capture, seeded
  stochastic sampling, and penalties. The long gate caught a CUDA lifecycle
  split where one-row catch-up captured as `mtp_decode_sequential_catchup` but
  replayed as `mtp_decode_catchup`; `DeviceGraphOrchestrator` now uses one
  canonical `kMTPDecodeCatchupContext`, guarded by
  `V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy`. Focused long gates:
  `V2_Integration_PrefixCacheMTP_Qwen36ROCmGpuGraphsStochasticClearCacheRepeatabilityLong`
  and
  `V2_Integration_PrefixCacheMTP_Qwen36CUDAGpuGraphsStochasticClearCacheRepeatabilityLong`
  pass. Penalty-free CUDA/ROCm stochastic smokes defer final sync for
  `main_verifier`, `mtp_decode_sidecar`, and `mtp_decode_catchup`; penalty-bearing
  long-context stochastic runs keep the verifier boundary synchronized because
  target-row penalties depend on sampler history between accepted tokens.
  Final closeout covered CUDA/ROCm graph-stream stress parity, the broad
  `V2_Unit_` gate, and both integration/release builds. Release configuration
  now guards graph-stream parity test properties when non-perf tests are skipped.

Work:

- Capture draft prefill, one-token draft decode, target verifier, greedy
  sampling, stochastic distribution/rejection, and publication helpers with
  persistent buffers.
- GPU stochastic graph capture must include Qwen chat defaults: temperature,
  top-k, top-p, penalties where supported, and seeded RNG metadata.
- CPU keeps the same transaction boundaries and uses optimized kernels rather
  than graph capture.

Exit gate:

- CUDA and ROCm dense greedy/stochastic graph stress tests pass at long context.
- No GPU lane needs final verifier sync before sampling unless explicitly
  documented.
- Perfstats expose capture/replay, stream handoff, sampler, and publication
  counters for every MTP step.

### Phase 7: Dense Performance Acceptance

Goal: make dense SingleDevice performant before MoE-specific tuning.

Work:

- Run the bounded matrix every iteration and full default matrix at acceptance
  checkpoints.
- Tune M=1..4 GEMV/GEMM, GDN/short-conv publication, row-indexed LM-head, and
  dynamic-depth hysteresis using the same evidence across CPU/CUDA/ROCm.
- Build a generated dynamic-depth policy pipeline, mirroring the GEMM/GEMV
  dispatch trainer pattern:
  - collect prompt/device/mode rows from
    `scripts/run_mtp_depth_hysteresis_sweep.sh` and the standard iteration
    matrix;
  - derive train/holdout labels from same-run fixed d1/d2/d3 throughput,
    acceptance, verifier cost, and sampling mode;
  - train a compact deterministic policy surface offline;
  - emit a checked-in C++ `.inc` table consumed by `MTPDepthController`;
  - validate generated policy decisions against holdout prompts before any table
    is accepted.
  The generated policy must stay explainable: runtime code consumes binned
  window statistics and emits promote/hold/demote decisions, not a black-box
  runtime model. The controller remains deterministic and all fixed-mode
  behavior remains untouched.
- Keep CUDA, ROCm, and CPU correctness surfaces symmetric.

Status:

- Generated dynamic-depth policy side quest is implemented. The checked-in
  trainer `scripts/train_mtp_depth_policy.py` consumes matrix/hysteresis
  `summary.tsv` rows, derives fixed-depth labels, enforces deterministic
  train/holdout gates when requested, skips low-confidence generated rules, and emits
  `src/v2/execution/mtp/MTPDepthPolicyGenerated.inc`. `MTPDepthController`
  consumes that table only in dynamic mode, keeps fixed mode untouched, and
  reports generated promote/demote reasons through normal depth-policy stats.
  The table is now verify-mode-aware: greedy and stochastic rows do not share a
  single depth-2 acceptance threshold, which avoids promoting stochastic d2
  requests into a known-poor d3 lane just because acceptance is high.
- The runtime and benchmark config surfaces expose
  `mtp_depth_generated_policy`, and the hysteresis plus iteration-matrix scripts
  report whether each dynamic lane used the generated table.
- The policy trainer now keys fixed-depth examples by source summary plus
  topology, device, model, mode, decode length, request batch, and prompt case
  when present. This prevents separate short/long or scalar/request-batched
  benchmark summaries with the same backend/model/mode from overwriting each
  other before labels are derived. The trainer also learns bounded acceptance
  intervals instead of only high-acceptance promotions, so future generated
  rules can express low-to-moderate probe regions without hand-editing the
  `.inc` table. Regression: `V2_Unit_MTPDepthPolicyTrainer`.
- Focused side-quest gates passed:
  `V2_Unit_MTPDepthController`, `V2_Unit_MTPDepthPolicyTrainer`,
  `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition`, `V2_Integration_GPUSamplingKernels`, and
  CUDA/ROCm Qwen3.6 stochastic verifier parity. Older proving-ground coverage
  also includes `V2_Unit_MTPIterationBenchmarkMatrix` and
  `V2_Perf_MTPDepthController`.
- The latest policy refresh
  `benchmark_results/mtp_depth_hysteresis/20260611T-rocm-dense-mode-aware-policy-short-code/`
  retrains from dense fixed d1/d2/d3 rows plus ROCm short/text/code prompts.
  The checked-in table uses conservative thresholds: greedy d1 promotes at
  acceptance >=0.87, greedy d2 at >=0.73, stochastic d1 at >=0.50, and
  stochastic d3 demotes at <=0.83. Stochastic d2 promotion is intentionally
  absent because the current runtime features cannot separate cases where d3 is
  best from cases where d2 should hold. A regression test now proves ambiguous
  generated rules are skipped, and the depth-zero bypass regression proves a
  generated promote cannot override an all-zero window.
- Conservative generated-policy sanity
  `benchmark_results/mtp_depth_hysteresis/20260611T-rocm-dense-conservative-policy-sanity/`
  shows generated-on is now neutral on QBF, modestly positive on C++ and tech
  prompts, and slightly negative on the Python prompt. This is accepted as a
  safe seed table; restoring stochastic depth-2 promotion requires richer live
  features than acceptance rate alone.
- Dense ROCm/CUDA catch-up slice refreshed fixed d1/d2/d3 plus dynamic for
  greedy and stochastic. ROCm greedy is in the CUDA speedup class
  (`20260611T-rocm-dense-catchup-baseline/`: fixed d3 67.6 tok/s, 2.16x).
  ROCm stochastic has now caught CUDA by speedup class after the accepted
  top-k=40 specialization, batched target/bonus top-k/top-p distribution API,
  and the latest NativeVNNI graph-capture cleanup. The batched API is a
  backend/runner contract for contiguous all-position verifier rows; it uses
  declared orchestrator scratch, explicit streams, and no allocation or
  synchronization in the kernels. ROCm NativeVNNI small-M graph capture now
  defaults to workspace split-reduce, with atomic reduce kept as an explicit
  tuning opt-in. `20260611T-rocm-dense-stochastic-split-reduce/` reports fixed
  d2 at 42.1 tok/s versus 30.2 baseline (1.394x), while
  `20260611T-rocm-dense-stochastic-explicit-atomic-ab/` reports 41.7 tok/s
  (1.374x).
  The full ROCm depth matrix
  `20260611T-rocm-dense-stochastic-full-depth-matrix/` reports d1/d2/d3 at
  37.1/41.7/35.2 tok/s over 30.2 baseline, proving d2 is the best stochastic
  lane for this prompt. The final dynamic run
  `20260611T-rocm-dense-stochastic-dynamic-generated-d3-only/` holds depth 2,
  reaches 41.9 tok/s (1.385x), and records zero depth updates. CUDA reference
  `20260611T-cuda-rocm-dense-stochastic-long-d2-dynamic/` reports fixed d2
  64.4 tok/s (1.473x) and dynamic 59.1 tok/s (1.351x), so ROCm is accepted as
  the same speedup class even though its absolute tok/s still lags.
  Fresh iteration evidence
  `20260611T124556Z-rocm-dense-stochastic-refresh` confirms the accepted
  status with the standard baseline,d1,d2,d3,dynamic lane set at 64 decode
  tokens: ROCm dynamic reaches 42.60 tok/s over 30.29 baseline (1.41x),
  accepts 108 tokens, rejects 12, records 90% acceptance, and promotes to
  depth 2 without rollbacks. The remaining dense ROCm work is absolute
  verifier/condition throughput, not a correctness or policy blocker.
  Focused gates passed: `V2_Unit_MTPDepthController`,
  `V2_Integration_ROCm_NativeVNNI_GEMV`,
  `V2_Integration_ROCmQuantisedGemmSmallM`, and ROCm Qwen3.6 stochastic
  verifier parity. Remaining ROCm dense absolute-gap evidence points at
  verifier/sidecar work drained at the all-position stochastic batch outcome
  sync, about 6.8s in the 128-token run, rather than the policy or sampler
  enqueue path.
  A one-token condition-decode replay-preservation experiment was
  benchmark-rejected and removed because the bounded lane reached
  warmup/capture but not replay, dropping ROCm d2 to 32.23 tok/s.
- ROCm batched NativeVNNI generated dispatch is not accepted for runtime use.
  The 2026-06-11 dense guard proved microbench cosine is not a sufficient
  promotion gate: generated batched entries collapsed ROCm dense d2 acceptance
  to near zero, while the restored generic path kept the expected 80%
  acceptance. The trainer now resets KB/TW overrides before building its
  canonical reference, but future batched generated entries must pass a
  model/verifier-equivalence gate before runtime promotion.
- NativeVNNI decode dispatch training is now M-aware and shared across the CUDA
  and ROCm refresh path. CUDA sweep CSVs include `m`, the CUDA tree trainer
  keys features by `(M,N,K)`, exact overlay keys pack `M`, and the CUDA small-M
  runtime path consumes generated shape/tuning for verifier rows instead of
  using an N,K-only route. ROCm decode trainer and runtime already use the same
  M-aware key shape. `scripts/refresh_native_vnni_dispatch_tables.sh` is the
  canonical sweep -> train -> validate wrapper for CUDA and ROCm; it has a
  dry-run unit guard, a stratified `family-smoke` profile that runs one bounded
  sweep per requested format before combining CSVs, and can install validated
  generated includes. The compact CUDA smoke
  `benchmark_results/native_vnni_dispatch/20260611T063908Z-cuda-m-aware-refresh-smoke/`
  produced real Q4_1 M=1..4 rows and a validated generated include. Stratified
  CUDA/ROCm smoke refreshes
  `benchmark_results/native_vnni_dispatch/20260611T065536Z-cuda-family-smoke-stratified/`
  and
  `benchmark_results/native_vnni_dispatch/20260611T065515Z-rocm-family-smoke-stratified/`
  proved actual per-format partial CSV generation, CSV combine, training, and
  generated-include validation for representative simple and IQ codebook
  families. The wrapper unit test now also guards the default `family-smoke`
  inventory so CUDA includes its `Q8_0` extension while ROCm stays on the
  supported quantized weight families. Project CUDA/ROCm tuning skills document
  `family-smoke` as the bounded proxy and `qwen36`/`all` plus parity/benchmarks
  as the only table-install acceptance path. Focused gates passed:
  `V2_Unit_NativeVNNIDispatchRefreshScript`,
  `V2_Unit_CUDAGemvDispatchGeneratorAliases`,
  `V2_Unit_CUDAGemvDispatchBaseMerge`,
  `V2_Unit_ROCmNativeVNNIDecodeTrainerGenerator`,
  `V2_Unit_ROCmNativeVNNITrainerCsvValidator`,
  `V2_Unit_NativeVNNIGeneratedDispatchCodebooks`, and dense CUDA Qwen3.6
  depth-3 MTP parity. The wrapper now also exposes staged strict profiles:
  `qwen36-core` for Qwen3.6 FFN/GDN projections and `qwen36-lm-head` for the
  high-cost LM-head shape. ROCm `qwen36-core` completed without installing
  tables:
  `benchmark_results/native_vnni_dispatch/20260611T072617Z-rocm-qwen36-core-refresh/`
  generated 360 entries across 15 codebook families and passed generated
  codebook validation. The post-refresh focused gate passed
  `V2_Unit_NativeVNNIDispatchRefreshScript`,
  `V2_Unit_CUDAGemvDispatchGeneratorAliases`,
  `V2_Unit_CUDAGemvDispatchBaseMerge`,
  `V2_Unit_ROCmNativeVNNIDecodeTrainerGenerator`,
  `V2_Unit_ROCmNativeVNNITrainerCsvValidator`,
  `V2_Unit_NativeVNNIGeneratedDispatchCodebooks`,
  `V2_Integration_ROCm_NativeVNNI_GEMV`, and
  `V2_Integration_ROCmQuantisedGemmSmallM`. A first full CUDA `qwen36-core`
  attempt was stopped after two completed cases in roughly two minutes, because
  the full strict profile is a long-running acceptance job rather than an
  inner-loop gate. That attempt exposed a trainer stream-hygiene regression:
  the CUDA sweep harness called `multiply_tensor()` without binding an explicit
  stream. `Perf__CUDABlockwiseTensorCoreGemmSweep.cpp` now creates a
  non-blocking CUDA stream, binds it with `setGPUStream()`, records timing
  events on that stream, and unbinds/destroys it on every exit path. A bounded
  CUDA qwen36-core representative refresh,
  `benchmark_results/native_vnni_dispatch/20260611T081007Z-cuda-qwen36-core-representative-stream-bound/`,
  swept Q4_0, Q4_K, IQ2_XXS, and Q8_0 on the qwen36 FFN GateUp shape for
  M=1..4, generated/validated a smoke include, and proved non-null stream
  binding in the trainer log. The strict generator threshold correctly rejects
  that partial CSV as a production table, so it is recorded as a smoke artifact
  only. CUDA `qwen36-lm-head`, full `qwen36`/`all`, and model-level
  parity/benchmarks remain pending before broad checked-in table replacement.
  Focused follow-up gates passed `V2_Unit_Static_NoDefaultStreamInGPUCode`,
  `V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy`, `V2_Unit_NativeVNNIDispatchRefreshScript`,
  `V2_Unit_CUDAGemvDispatchGeneratorAliases`,
  `V2_Unit_CUDAGemvDispatchBaseMerge`,
  `V2_Unit_ROCmNativeVNNIDecodeTrainerGenerator`,
  `V2_Unit_ROCmNativeVNNITrainerCsvValidator`, and
  `V2_Unit_NativeVNNIGeneratedDispatchCodebooks`. The ROCm trainer
  also gained an explicit `LLAMINAR_ROCM_NVNNI_DECODE_REFERENCE` mode:
  normal/core profiles keep the FP32 hipBLAS health reference, while
  `qwen36-lm-head` defaults to `native-auto` so the giant LM-head shape can
  compare candidates against a reset-AUTO native output without materializing a
  multi-GB FP32 weight mirror. A one-format LM-head smoke,
  `benchmark_results/native_vnni_dispatch/20260611T075534Z-rocm-qwen36-lm-head-native-auto-smoke/`,
  passed for Q4_0/M=1 and generated one validated entry. The trainer now treats
  already-uploaded packed weights as valid, because first-use upload clears host
  packing buffers while keeping the device upload cache authoritative.
  CUDA LM-head smoke
  `benchmark_results/native_vnni_dispatch/20260611T081631Z-cuda-qwen36-lm-head-smoke/`
  passed for Q4_0/M=1 with the stream-bound trainer and generated one
  validated entry. This proves the huge LM-head shape is tractable in the
  staged pipeline, but all-format LM-head and model-level parity still gate any
  checked-in CUDA table update. Follow-up inspection found the CUDA M=2..4
  sweep path was labelling candidates while the specialized small-M dispatcher
  still used the current generated runtime route. `CUDANativeVNNIGemvTuned.cu`
  now consumes the sweep override for real KPAR small-M candidate launches, and
  the perf harness filters out WIDE/DIRECT/ROWPAR for M=2..4 because the
  VRAM-pool prepared harness can only execute KPAR verifier kernels today.
  The standard CUDA refresh family set is therefore `wide,kpar,direct` for M=1
  and executable KPAR rows for M=2..4; ROWPAR needs a future row-major-owner
  trainer before it can appear in production generated tables. Focused smoke
  `benchmark_results/native_vnni_dispatch/20260611T091538Z-cuda-smallm-real-candidate-smoke/`
  proved the corrected path with Q4_0 Qwen3.6 GDN time projection M=2:
  648 real KPAR rows, zero small-M failure logs, generated validation passed,
  and best tile 128x1/waves4/mkg4 at 13.312 us. The CUDA sweep trainer now
  uses deterministic valid packed tensors for dispatch sweeps instead of
  per-element random quantized fixtures, prepares/uploads/repackages each
  format+shape once before candidate timing, and sizes its
  `DeviceWorkspaceManager` budget from declared `IWorkspaceConsumer`
  requirements. This keeps giant LM-head refreshes practical while retaining
  the production tensor classes and GPU preparation path. The CUDA overlay
  generator fallback is also M-aware now, matching the base tree and exact
  `(M,N,K)` overrides; `V2_Unit_CUDAGemvDispatchBaseMerge` includes a split-M
  fixture where one LM-head shape wants WIDE/DIRECT at M=1 and KPAR at M=2..4
  and an alias-conflict fixture proving Q4_1/Q4_K style source-format winners
  collapse to one codebook-level runtime dispatch row before exact thresholds.
  A strict CUDA Q4_0 LM-head refresh,
  `benchmark_results/native_vnni_dispatch/20260611T094334Z-cuda-qwen36-lm-head-q4_0-full-candidates-maware/`,
  swept the full candidate grid for M=1..4 in about 62 seconds, produced 2708
  rows, passed generated validation, and reported 100% overall/fallback
  family/exact hit rates. Full CUDA all-format LM-head refresh,
  `benchmark_results/native_vnni_dispatch/20260611T094803Z-cuda-qwen36-lm-head-all-formats/`,
  completed the full M=1..4 candidate grid in about 19.5 minutes, wrote 51,452
  sweep rows, collapsed 76 source-format winners to 64 runtime dispatch keys,
  reconciled 6 alias-conflict keys, and generated a validated include with
  100% final family/exact/fallback hit rates. Full CUDA qwen36-core refresh,
  `benchmark_results/native_vnni_dispatch/20260611T101337Z-cuda-qwen36-core-all-formats/`,
  completed the six Qwen3.6 core FFN/GDN shapes across all CUDA decode formats
  in about 10.8 minutes, wrote 308,712 sweep rows, observed KPAR as the best
  family for all 456 source-format winners, collapsed them to 384 runtime
  dispatch keys, reconciled 64 alias-conflict keys, and generated a validated
  include with 100% final family/exact hit rates. Combined CUDA qwen36 artifact,
  `benchmark_results/native_vnni_dispatch/20260611T102638Z-cuda-qwen36-combined-from-staged/`,
  was generated from the staged core plus LM-head CSVs without rerunning GPU
  sweeps. It covers 360,164 rows, 532 source-format winners, 448 runtime
  dispatch keys, 70 alias-conflict keys, and validates with 100% final
  family/exact hit rates. Full ROCm LM-head refresh
  `benchmark_results/native_vnni_dispatch/20260611T082004Z-rocm-qwen36-lm-head-full/`
  completed without installing tables. It ran all 18 ROCm text formats across
  M=1..4, produced 72 best rows, collapsed aliases into 60 generated dispatch
  entries across 15 codebook ids, and passed generated codebook validation.
  Every completed row matched the `native-auto` reference with cosine 1.0.
  IQ3_S/IQ3_XXS and IQ1_S/IQ1_M are correct but show weaker M>1 LM-head
  speedups than the Q/K/IQ2 families, so they are follow-up tuning candidates
  after model-level parity accepts any table promotion. Combined ROCm qwen36
  artifact,
  `benchmark_results/native_vnni_dispatch/20260611T102802Z-rocm-qwen36-combined-from-staged/`,
  was generated from the staged ROCm core plus LM-head CSVs without rerunning
  kernels. It covers 6048 candidate rows across 18 ROCm formats and 7 Qwen3.6
  shapes, and emits 420 generated dispatch entries across 15 codebook ids. The
  post-refresh
  generated-dispatch gate passed
  `V2_Unit_Static_NoDefaultStreamInGPUCode`,
  `V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy`,
  `V2_Unit_NativeVNNIDispatchRefreshScript`,
  `V2_Unit_CUDAGemvDispatchGeneratorAliases`,
  `V2_Unit_CUDAGemvDispatchBaseMerge`,
  `V2_Unit_ROCmNativeVNNIDecodeTrainerGenerator`,
  `V2_Unit_ROCmNativeVNNITrainerCsvValidator`, and
  `V2_Unit_NativeVNNIGeneratedDispatchCodebooks`.
  The combined CUDA and ROCm generated tables are now installed in
  `CUDANativeVNNIGemvDispatchHeuristicGenerated.inc` and
  `ROCmNativeVNNIDecodeDispatchGenerated.inc`. Promotion evidence passed:
  the generated-dispatch unit/static gate, `V2_Integration_ROCm_NativeVNNI_GEMV`,
  `V2_Integration_ROCmQuantisedGemmSmallM`, and the symmetric dense Qwen3.6
  CUDA/ROCm MTP parity gate covering fixed d1/d3, dynamic depth, forward-only
  equivalence, stochastic verifier smoke, and benchmark-prompt known-window
  diagnostics. The only failure found during promotion was not a generated-table
  regression: ROCm teacher-forced benchmark-prompt parity hits a documented
  PyTorch FP32 versus quantized ROCm near-tie at decode step 6, where ROCm ranks
  token 4338 at 20.802 over PyTorch token 1092 at 20.793. The harness now keeps
  exact PyTorch-token checks before that row, asserts the near-tie remains small,
  and leaves long MTP checks comparing against the backend no-MTP baseline.
  Installed-table benchmark matrix
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260611T-post-generated-dispatch-dense-cuda-rocm/`
  covered dense CUDA/ROCm greedy and stochastic baseline,d1,d2,d3,dynamic rows
  at 64 decode tokens. CUDA remains speed-positive: greedy d3 reaches
  91.4 tok/s (2.08x over 44.0 baseline) and stochastic d3 reaches
  65.7 tok/s (1.49x over 44.0 baseline). ROCm greedy is also speed-positive:
  d3 reaches 65.0 tok/s (2.14x over 30.3 baseline). Follow-up perfstats first
  exposed stochastic rejection-condition cost as the ROCm blocker; the later
  `20260611T124556Z-rocm-dense-stochastic-refresh` matrix closes that bounded
  lane with dynamic at 42.60 tok/s over 30.29 baseline (1.41x), 90%
  acceptance, and zero rollbacks. Dense CUDA/ROCm relative speedup is now
  accepted; future dense work should target ROCm absolute verifier/condition
  throughput without weakening the shared sampler or parity gates.
- ROCm default `family-smoke` now runs through the full supported decode
  codebook inventory. The first all-format attempt exposed Q4_K/M=3 and Q2_K/M=1
  as FP32 hipBLAS health-gate false negatives rather than dispatch mismatches:
  Q4_K/M=3 is covered by an expanded Qwen3.6 GDN time-projection packed native
  contract regression, and `V2_Integration_ROCm_NativeVNNI_GEMV` plus
  `V2_Integration_ROCmQuantisedGemmSmallM` remain the exact dispatch-equivalence
  gates. After documenting those ROCm trainer health gates, the all-format smoke
  `benchmark_results/native_vnni_dispatch/20260611T070818Z-rocm-family-smoke-all-formats/`
  generated 60 decode entries across 15 codebooks and passed validation.
- CUDA default `family-smoke` also runs through its full decode inventory,
  including the CUDA-only `Q8_0` codebook. The all-format smoke
  `benchmark_results/native_vnni_dispatch/20260611T071116Z-cuda-family-smoke-all-formats/`
  swept 58,235 candidate rows, trained the fallback tree, layered 76 exact
  known-shape overrides across 16 codebooks, and passed generated codebook
  validation. This exposed a policy issue rather than a kernel issue:
  `family-smoke` now uses proxy hit-rate thresholds while `qwen36`/`all` keep
  strict CUDA fallback-family/exact thresholds for production table acceptance.
  After fixing the CUDA small-M relabel/fallthrough bug, the corrected
  all-format smoke
  `benchmark_results/native_vnni_dispatch/20260611T091656Z-cuda-family-smoke-all-formats-corrected-smallm/`
  produced 51,452 executable rows, covered 16 codebook ids, generated 76
  known-shape overrides, validated the generated include, and had zero
  small-M failure logs. This corrected artifact supersedes the earlier CUDA
  family-smoke evidence for M=2..4 trainer behavior.
- Dynamic warm-start cleanup is accepted for the bounded dense stochastic lane.
  `MTPDepthController` now resolves an unset dynamic initial depth to depth 2
  when the configured range allows it, while preserving explicit depth-zero
  bypass. `scripts/run_mtp_iteration_benchmark_matrix.sh` no longer hard-pins
  dynamic rows to `--mtp-initial-draft-tokens 1`, so the matrix measures the
  runtime policy default. Runtime-default checks:
  `20260611T-rocm-dense-stochastic-dynamic-runtime-default-d2/` reports ROCm
  dynamic at 34.34 tok/s, 1.10x, 80% acceptance, zero updates; and
  `20260611T-cuda-dense-stochastic-dynamic-runtime-default-d2/` reports CUDA
  dynamic at 54.20 tok/s, 1.21x, 80% acceptance, zero updates.
- Deepest-lane dynamic policy is now generated-table only. Handwritten fallback
  promotion still handles shallow probes, but it no longer enters the maximum
  draft depth on perfect or ambiguous lower-depth windows. This keeps the
  default stochastic prompt on the proven fixed-d2 lane instead of paying d3
  probes, while preserving generated greedy d2-to-d3 promotion where the table
  has evidence.
- Prefix/MTP full-hit restore regression is fixed. Prefix harvest now refreshes
  the terminal hidden row from the just-finished prefill before storing a
  terminal MTP block, so a stored block no longer advertises MTP state while
  lacking the terminal hidden needed by the sidecar. Focused CUDA/ROCm
  Qwen3.6 dense `PrefixCacheMTPRestore` and
  `PrefixCacheMTPDynamicDepthRestore` parity tests pass.

Exit gate:

- Dense greedy and stochastic are correct on CPU/CUDA/ROCm.
- CUDA and ROCm post comparable speedup classes versus their no-MTP baselines;
  if one backend lags, it gets a tuning pass before acceptance.
- Dynamic approaches the best fixed depth for the prompt class after warmup.
- The generated dynamic-depth policy trainer has unit coverage for CSV parsing,
  holdout evaluation, and generated `.inc` output; controller unit tests prove
  generated recommendations are bounded by min/max depth and do not affect fixed
  policy mode.

### Phase 8: MoE SingleDevice Parity With Dense Contract

Goal: run Qwen3.6 MoE through the same transaction, metadata, sampler, and
publication contract as dense.

Work:

- Reuse the dense transaction driver for MoE.
- Make routed/shared expert sidecar and verifier stages graph-native with
  workspace-declared scratch.
- Persist only continuation state; expert routing payloads, histograms, and
  sparse scratch remain transient.
- Ensure CUDA and ROCm use the same MoE strategy before backend-specific tuning.

Status:

- First ROCm MoE tuning slice landed a backend parity fix with direct perf
  impact. ROCm `softmax_topk` now mirrors CUDA's block-wide parallel top-k
  selection instead of scanning all experts on thread 0 after softmax. The
  kernel preserves the previous ascending expert-id tie order, leaves router
  probability rows intact for diagnostics, rejects null/default streams and
  unsupported bounds, and is covered by
  `Test__ROCmMoEKernel.SoftmaxTopKParallelSelectionPreservesTieOrder` plus the
  existing verifier-shaped small-M router regression.
- Evidence: `20260611T-rocm-moe-parallel-topk/` reduced ROCm MoE stochastic
  fixed-d2 verifier router time from 291.8 ms to 51.9 ms and verifier total
  from 951.8 ms to 768.4 ms in the profiled lane. The non-profiled bounded
  matrix `20260611T-rocm-moe-parallel-topk-matrix/` moved fixed d2 from the
  previous 33.3 tok/s to 43.2 tok/s against a same-run 68.1 tok/s baseline.
  ROCm Qwen3.6 MoE stochastic verifier parity passed after the change.
- Full-ownership SingleDevice GPU MoE now advertises sidecar main-state
  preservation, matching the dense transaction contract. The predicate is
  intentionally ownership-based rather than enum-based: CUDA/ROCm SingleDevice
  production graphs may use the `ExpertParallel` label while still owning the
  full expert set (`local_expert_count < 0`, no overlay plan). CPU and sparse
  ExpertParallel overlays remain conservative. The focused unit
  `Test__DeviceGraphOrchestrator.SidecarMainStatePreservationIsInitializedAndTopologyBounded`
  covers this boundary, and CUDA/ROCm Qwen3.6 MoE stochastic parity passed with
  `LLAMINAR_MTP_VERIFY_SIDECAR_PRESERVES_MAIN_STATE=1`.
- Evidence: `20260611T-rocm-moe-sidecar-preserve-fullowner-d2/` removes
  `all_position_verifier_base_restores`, records
  `all_position_verifier_base_restore_skipped_sidecar_preserved`, and lets
  `main_verifier` reach segmented replay. ROCm stochastic fixed d2 moved to
  46.1 tok/s. The matching CUDA lane
  `20260611T-cuda-moe-sidecar-preserve-fullowner-d2/` also skips restore and
  reaches verifier replay, with fixed d2 at 62.5 tok/s.
- Long-lane MoE evidence is now the sprint steering signal:
  `20260611T144241Z-moe-cuda-rocm-longlane` shows CUDA MoE remains
  speed-negative in greedy and stochastic even at d2/d3, while ROCm greedy can
  barely exceed baseline only through dynamic policy and ROCm stochastic remains
  negative. A backend-neutral attempt to force ROCm shared-expert verifier rows
  onto grouped prefill was benchmark-rejected:
  `20260611T145646Z-moe-rocm-shared-grouped` regressed ROCm greedy d2/d3/dynamic
  to 69.1/64.7/60.5 tok/s. The CUDA tile_m sweep also found no stable default
  promotion.
- Focused verifier-prefill perf/parity coverage now exists as
  `V2_Perf_MoEVerifierPrefill`. It exercises CUDA and ROCm M=1/2/3/4 routed
  top-k and shared expert rows at the production Qwen3.6 MoE shape
  (`d_model=2048`, `intermediate=512`, 256 routed experts), compares grouped
  verifier prefill against row-wise decode-equivalent rows, and times eager plus
  graph-replay execution. The release CTest gate passed with reduced iteration
  counts for sprint use, and the short CSV run showed graph replay is already
  sub-millisecond for these kernels: CUDA routed M1/M2/M3/M4 =
  0.154/0.168/0.183/0.192 ms, CUDA shared = 0.099/0.105/0.114/0.118 ms,
  ROCm routed = 0.242/0.266/0.337/0.339 ms, ROCm shared =
  0.144/0.158/0.212/0.227 ms, all with cosine 1.0 against decode-equivalent
  output. That shifts the next Phase 8 tuning target away from isolated
  grouped prefill itself and toward full verifier economics: routed/shared FFN
  cost across all layers, rejection condition replay, and sidecar LM-head /
  sampling work.
- Fresh clean MoE depth sweep with perfstats:
  `20260611T_moe_perfstats_depth_sprint`. CUDA greedy baseline/d1/d2/d3/dynamic
  = 136.5/83.6/97.0/106.1/81.8 tok/s; CUDA stochastic =
  137.1/79.8/84.3/85.4/78.4. ROCm greedy =
  76.5/75.6/78.2/83.1/81.0; ROCm stochastic =
  76.4/59.1/59.0/61.6/56.4. Acceptance is healthy enough that draft quality is
  not the primary blocker: CUDA greedy d3 is 84.4%, ROCm greedy d3 is 85.3%,
  and ROCm stochastic d2 is 86.3%.
- ROCm exact combined shared-gate verifier prefill now uses an IQ4_NL byte-pair
  decode table for the Qwen3.6 shared expert path. The production-shaped
  speedometer improved ROCm graph replay from about 0.702 ms to 0.506 ms with
  cosine 1.0 against the split routed+shared reference; CUDA on the same shape
  is about 0.350 ms. `V2_Integration_ROCmMoEKernel` and focused CUDA/ROCm exact
  verifier perf gates pass after the change.
- The production-shaped combined shared-gate verifier speedometer now covers
  the fixed-depth target-row counts M=2/3/4 instead of only the depth-3 M=4
  case. Reduced direct run evidence: CUDA graph replay 0.308/0.330/0.351 ms,
  ROCm graph replay 0.444/0.462/0.509 ms, all cosine 1.0 against the split
  routed+shared reference. The full `V2_Perf_MoEVerifierPrefill` CTest passed,
  so future MoE tuning can use this curve as the per-depth kernel baseline.
- Fresh post-IQ4 full MoE GPU matrix:
  `20260612T_moe_gpu_post_iq4pair_matrix`. CUDA remains speed-negative in every
  MoE lane despite high acceptance: greedy baseline/d1/d2/d3/dynamic =
  139.2/84.2/98.9/107.2/106.3 tok/s and stochastic =
  139.6/81.3/90.8/96.9/105.5. ROCm greedy dynamic is the first barely
  speed-positive GPU MoE lane at 81.6 tok/s versus 77.7 baseline, but fixed
  depths remain negative; ROCm stochastic remains negative at
  49.0/48.9/38.8/50.8 versus 77.4 baseline. Perfstats show CUDA is limited by
  verifier plus condition-forward economics, while ROCm still attributes large
  time to the compact greedy/stochastic outcome sync boundary.
- Correction-replay small-M routing was tested and rejected in
  `20260611T_moe_correction_replay_sprint`. Splitting the one-token rejected
  correction condition forward into a distinct graph signature and forcing the
  verifier-prefill MoE route regressed the same-run full matrix: CUDA greedy d3
  moved from 106.1 to 97.8 tok/s and ROCm greedy d3 from 83.1 to 71.4 tok/s.
  The experiment has been removed so future tuning does not inherit a dead-end
  graph mode.
- Stage attribution from `20260611T_moe_stage_timing_probe` shows the next
  optimization should stay on full graph economics rather than per-expert
  correctness. CUDA main-verifier d3 is dominated by routed FFN (~46 ms over
  the short probe) plus shared FFN (~43 ms), with GDN/router support work next.
  ROCm main verifier is dominated by routed FFN (~78-80 ms), then shared FFN,
  router, GDN, GEMM, and attention. Sidecar attribution shows LM head as the
  largest sidecar stage, so sidecar LM-head/sampling fusion is the next
  second-order target once verifier FFN economics are improved.
- MoE remains speed-negative, so Phase 8 is not accepted. The next bottleneck
  is verifier/condition/sidecar transaction cost, not publication, router
  correctness, isolated grouped prefill, or verifier-base restore churn. For
  stochastic MoE specifically, the vLLM processed-logit/one-hot-q verifier is
  functionally green on CUDA and ROCm, but the same-run matrix is still
  speed-negative. Continue from profiler evidence on verifier, condition, and
  queued GPU sampling work rather than reviving compact-table or full-prob row
  verifier variants.
- Fresh GPU stage-timing probe
  `20260612T225841Z-moe-stochastic-gpu-stage-timing` keeps the conclusion
  sharp: CUDA best dynamic is 81.6 versus 114.4 tok/s baseline, and ROCm best
  d1 is 51.5 versus 68.7 tok/s baseline. The new `--gpu-stage-timing` evidence
  shows routed expert FFN dominates both main-decode condition rows and
  main-verifier rows. The stochastic D2H bucket is mostly the host-visible
  synchronization boundary draining queued model work, not the primary kernel
  target. The next Phase 8 slice should therefore reduce repeated full MoE
  condition/verifier transaction work before deeper sampler tuning.
- vLLM source inspection confirms that the known-good path samples the bonus
  row up front and processes target verifier rows as a batch. Llaminar's
  processed-target, greedy-draft/one-hot-q stochastic verifier is therefore
  architecturally aligned at the sampler level. The remaining speed gap is that
  Llaminar benchmarks one request at a time, so every MoE speculative step pays
  a tiny-batch 40-layer target/condition transaction. The next Phase 8
  implementation slice should add request-batched speculative transaction
  support and a benchmark lane that measures amortized target verification,
  rather than reviving compact-table sampler shortcuts or lazy bonus sampling.
- First request-batching groundwork is in shared metadata: accepted-count
  verifier outcomes can now build one padded multi-request metadata batch with
  flattened verifier state slots, while unknown rejected device draft ids stay
  invalid instead of being synthesized on host. Focused gates:
  `V2_Unit_MTPSpecDecodeMetadata`, `V2_Unit_MTPSpecStateContract`, and the
  broader MTP unit gate passed. The next implementation step is to feed these
  batched outcomes from a runner/benchmark path instead of only unit fixtures.
- The request-batch intent knob is now explicit: `MTPRuntimeConfig` carries
  `max_request_batch`, CLI/YAML accept `--mtp-max-request-batch` /
  `max_request_batch`, benchmark JSON and the iteration matrix summary export
  it. Early revisions hard-failed values other than 1; the live greedy
  SingleDevice path now treats it as capacity/intent instead of disabling
  ordinary scalar MTP decode.
- A shared `MTPSpecTransactionDriver` now builds a full batch transaction plan
  from accepted outcomes or greedy catch-up: metadata, commit plan,
  publication plan, and per-request `MTPSpecStepPlan` are produced in one
  checked object. `OrchestrationRunner` consumes this driver for the current
  single-request all-position publication path, so the future request-batched
  scheduler path will attach to the same accepted-count semantics instead of
  cloning runner-local metadata construction. Focused gates:
  `V2_Unit_MTPSpecStateContract` and `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition`.
- The greedy all-position path now has the same batched verifier-to-publication
  adapter as accepted-count stochastic outcomes. `MTPDecodeCatchup` splits one
  compact sampled-row batch into per-request results, metadata construction
  builds one padded multi-request greedy batch, and
  `MTPSpecTransactionDriver` returns a single publication plan for mixed
  all-accepted and rejected requests. Focused gates:
  `V2_Unit_MTPDecodeCatchup`, `V2_Unit_MTPSpecDecodeMetadata`, and
  `V2_Unit_MTPSpecStateContract`.
- Compact verifier scratch now scales with request-batch intent instead of the
  historical four-row constant. `mtp_target_query_rows` resolves to
  `max(4, max_request_batch * (draft_tokens + 1))`, the Qwen/Qwen3/Qwen3.5
  schemas use it for `lm_head_input_rows`, and CPU graph construction proves a
  two-request/depth-two capacity by comparing six row-indexed verifier logits
  against full all-position logits. Focused gates:
  `V2_Unit_MTPGraphConstruction`, `V2_Unit_QwenStandardGraphSchema`,
  `V2_Unit_Qwen3BufferSizes`, and `V2_Unit_Qwen35BufferSizes`.
- Compact verifier row selection now consumes an explicit verifier row plan
  instead of assuming leading rows. `GraphConfig` and `IGraphBuilder` carry the
  selected-row vector, `DeviceGraphOrchestrator` installs it from the MTP
  verifier input plan, and Qwen graph construction validates the rows against
  the real verifier activation tensor. GPU cached graphs still read row indices
  from metadata workspace, while CPU graph construction gets the same logical
  plan through the builder. Focused gate:
  `V2_Unit_MTPGraphConstruction.RowIndexedAllPositionLogitsRespectExplicitVerifierRowsOnCPU`.
- Verifier graph execution now has an explicit logical-to-padded materializer.
  `MTPSpecDecodeVerifierGraphForwardPlan` splits flattened request verifier
  tokens into `forward_batch()` input batches, maps compact verifier and bonus
  rows into padded graph-row coordinates, and feeds those rows into both
  metadata upload and CPU graph construction. `DeviceGraphOrchestrator`
  forwards actual per-request sequence lengths during padded batch execution
  and restores cumulative request state afterwards. Focused gates:
  `V2_Unit_MTPSpecDecodeMetadata`, `V2_Unit_MTPGraphConstruction`, and the
  bounded MTP/schema unit gate.
- Runner verifier forwards now go through `MTPVerifierForwardExecutor`.
  The helper materializes graph coordinates once, routes single-request host
  tokens through `forward()`, single-request device-token rows through
  `forwardWithDeviceTokenIds()`, and multi-request host tokens through
  `forward_batch()`. Multi-request device-token rows now use the explicit
  runner-local `forwardBatchWithDeviceTokenIds()` contract: callers supply
  logical host shadows plus a padded flat device buffer, and unsupported
  topologies hard-fail rather than sharing one raw pointer across participants.
  Focused gates:
  `V2_Unit_MTPVerifierForwardExecutor` and the bounded MTP/schema unit gate.
- Greedy request-batched verifier transactions are now executable as a shared
  helper. `executeMTPGreedyVerifierBatchTransaction()` enables row-indexed
  verifier logits, installs the compact row plan, executes the padded batch
  forward, samples compact rows, cleans up row mode on success or failure, and
  returns one batched transaction/publication plan. Focused gate:
  `V2_Unit_MTPVerifierForwardExecutor`. The same helper is now proven against
  the real CPU `DeviceGraphOrchestrator` verifier graph, including paired
  all-position/row-indexed mode ownership. Focused gate:
  `V2_Unit_MTPGraphConstruction`.
- Device-reduced stochastic outcomes now feed the same request-batched
  transaction driver. `buildMTPSpecTransactionBatchPlanFromDeviceRejectionOutcomes()`
  validates compact CUDA/ROCm-style outcomes against request shapes, converts
  them to accepted-count metadata, and produces the same flattened
  commit/publication/step plans as greedy catch-up. Focused gate:
  `V2_Unit_MTPSpecStateContract`.
- The live single-request GPU stochastic path now consumes that device-outcome
  transaction helper instead of rebuilding accepted outcomes locally. This
  keeps today's request-1 publication semantics on the same code path future
  request-batched scheduling will use. Focused gate:
  `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition`.
- Qwen35/Qwen36 MTP sidecar graph construction now allows bounded one-token
  request batches. The graph still rejects more than four total MTP rows,
  non-KV full sidecars with `seq_len != 1`, and multi-token catchup shapes
  that are not single-request. Focused gate: `V2_Unit_MTPGraphConstruction`.
- `DeviceGraphOrchestrator` can now publish one terminal-hidden row per
  request for a one-token batch. The multi-row row-select helper accepts the
  producer stream just like the single-row selector, preventing GPU stream
  races when this path is wired into graph-captured request batching. It still
  rejects multi-token per-request batches. Focused gate:
  `V2_Unit_MTPGraphConstruction`.
- Batched verifier forwards with an installed MTP row plan now route through
  the decode graph cache instead of the ordinary batched prefill path, giving
  accepted-state publication the exact padded verifier graph it must restore
  from. `DeviceGraphOrchestrator::publishAcceptedMTPSpecStateBatch()` now
  validates common padded shape, publishes KV per request index, restores
  stage state from each request's physical verifier row, updates per-request
  positions, and packs terminal-hidden rows atomically. Mixed zero-accepted
  shifted-KV batches still hard-fail before mutation until the scheduler owns
  correction replay for those lanes. Focused gates:
  `V2_Unit_MTPGraphConstruction` and the bounded Phase 8 unit cluster.
- Live all-position publication now goes through the batch contract end to
  end for request-count one. `OrchestrationRunner` calls
  `publishAcceptedMTPSpecStateBatch()`, and `RankOrchestrator` clamps each
  request through the common-prefix helper before publishing the batch on
  every LocalTP or LocalPP participant. This removes the side-door single-step
  publication dependency from the vLLM-style path while keeping unsupported
  participants as hard failures. Focused gates:
  `V2_Unit_RankOrchestrator`, `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition`, and the
  bounded Phase 8 unit cluster.
- Request-batch admission now has a first-class scheduler contract.
  `MTPSpecRequestBatchScheduler` groups pending requests in stable order,
  admits only matching mode/topology/vocab shapes, preserves variable verifier
  token counts within the configured padded shape, and records deferred versus
  rejected reasons before any runner state mutates. `MTPVerifierForwardExecutor`
  now accepts a scheduled greedy batch
  through a narrow adapter and feeds the existing padded verifier transaction
  helper, proving scheduler output is executable without teaching the
  scheduler about runner entrypoints. Focused gates:
  `V2_Unit_MTPSpecRequestBatchScheduler`, `V2_Unit_MTPVerifierForwardExecutor`,
  and the bounded MTP metadata/transaction cluster.
- Batched device-token verifier rows now have a named SingleDevice runner
  contract. `DeviceGraphOrchestrator::forwardBatchWithDeviceTokenIds()` builds
  a padded host shadow for bookkeeping, preserves per-request sequence lengths,
  and routes embedding through the caller-owned flat device token buffer. This
  removes the executor-layer single-row limitation, while Rank/TP/PP paths
  still hard-fail until they own per-participant device-token buffers. Focused
  gates: `V2_Unit_MTPVerifierForwardExecutor` and the bounded Phase 8 unit
  cluster.
- Greedy verifier transaction helpers now carry
  `MTPVerifierForwardExecutionOptions`, so scheduled request batches can select
  the padded device-token runner contract instead of being stuck on host-token
  `forward_batch()`. Focused gate: `V2_Unit_MTPVerifierForwardExecutor`.
- Request-batch scheduler admission now treats verifier input placement as part
  of the batch shape. Homogeneous host-token and device-token batches are
  admitted, mixed placement is deferred before mutation, and the scheduled
  executor hard-fails if placement and `device_token_ids` disagree. Focused
  gates: `V2_Unit_MTPSpecRequestBatchScheduler` and
  `V2_Unit_MTPVerifierForwardExecutor`.
- Request-batch ownership now has a two-phase CPU contract. The new
  `MTPSpecRequestBatchOwner` reserves scheduled requests without removing them,
  rejects duplicate ids and in-flight mutations, commits only admitted request
  ids after publication succeeds, and releases reservations unchanged after a
  failed verifier/publication transaction. This gives benchmark/server batching
  a concrete handoff point instead of letting scheduler output silently drop
  live requests. Focused gate: `V2_Unit_MTPSpecRequestBatchOwner`.
- Owned greedy request-batched verifier execution now has a single helper that
  schedules through the owner, executes the existing padded verifier
  transaction, commits admitted requests on verifier-only success, and releases
  the reservation unchanged on forward/sampling/transaction failure. A
  publication-aware variant now takes a caller-supplied accepted-state publisher
  and commits only after that publisher succeeds; publication failure releases
  the reservation without dropping pending requests. This proves the next
  benchmark/server batch lane can use scheduler output without reimplementing
  ownership cleanup or committing before live-state publication. Focused gate:
  `V2_Unit_MTPVerifierForwardExecutor`.
- Owned stochastic request-batched publication now has the matching
  device-outcome coordinator. The owner reserves an admitted stochastic batch,
  a producer callback returns compact `MTPDeviceRejectionBatchOutcome` rows for
  exactly that batch, shared transaction planning validates accepted counts and
  publication slots, and the owner commits only after the caller's
  accepted-state publisher succeeds. Producer, planning, or publication failure
  releases the reservation unchanged. Focused gates:
  `V2_Unit_MTPVerifierForwardExecutor`, `V2_Unit_MTPSpecRequestBatchOwner`,
  `V2_Unit_MTPSpecRequestBatchScheduler`, `V2_Unit_MTPSpecStateContract`, and
  `V2_Unit_MTPRejectionSampler`.
- Request-batch intent now reserves runner capacity before runner construction.
  `RuntimeConfig::fromOrchestrationConfig()` resolves effective `batch_size`
  from the larger of `--batch-size` and enabled `--mtp-max-request-batch`, and
  named-domain runners consume the resolved value instead of the raw CLI value.
  Graph/state capacity can no longer be silently under-sized when request
  batching is enabled.
  Focused gate: `V2_Unit_PrefixMTPConfig`.
- Benchmark prefill/decode now has an explicit request-batched runner contract.
  `IInferenceRunner` exposes `supportsPrefillBatchForBenchmark()`,
  `prefillBatchForBenchmark()`, `supportsDecodeStepBatchForBenchmark()`, and
  `decodeBatchStepForBenchmark()`, and `BenchmarkRunner` uses those paths
  whenever enabled MTP requests `max_request_batch > 1`. The benchmark treats
  `n_predict` as a per-request target, reports aggregate emitted tokens across
  the admitted batch, and keeps request-0 text/tokens only for compact human
  inspection. Runners that only support request-0 prefill or single-request
  decode hard-fail instead of producing fake batched measurements. Focused
  gate: `V2_Unit_BenchmarkRunnerCPU`.
- The request-batched benchmark path now has matching orchestration-level
  landing zones. `IOrchestrationRunner` exposes `supportsPrefillBatch()`,
  `prefillBatch()`, `supportsDecodeStepBatch()`, and `decodeStepBatch()`, and
  `InferenceRunnerAdapter` forwards those results into the benchmark contract.
  The default remains an explicit unsupported result until each topology wires
  the request owner, scheduler, verifier, and publication callbacks into live
  state. SingleDevice greedy has started replacing that unsupported result.
  Focused gate: `V2_Unit_BenchmarkRunnerCPU`.
- `OrchestrationRunner::prefillBatch()` now owns the first live SingleDevice
  request-batch state boundary. It validates MTP config, prefix-cache and
  topology exclusions, MPI single-rank execution, and runner batch capacity,
  calls `forward_batch()` once for the admitted prompt rows, records per-request
  terminal-token readiness, and blocks scalar `decodeStep()` while that batched
  live state is active. `clearCache()` releases the batched state. Later Phase 8
  slices consume these slots through `decodeStepBatch()`. Focused gate:
  `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition`.
- `OrchestrationRunner::decodeStepBatch()` now consumes the ready terminal
  prefill logits for each live SingleDevice request slot without looping scalar
  `decodeStep()` or re-feeding request 0. The bridge validates per-request
  sequence metadata, samples or consumes each row's terminal token, and records
  generated token state. Later Phase 8 slices have extended this bridge into
  the request-owner sidecar/verifier/publication transaction below. Focused
  gate: `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition`.
- Variable-length request-batched prefill can now publish one stable
  terminal-hidden row per request for MTP sidecar input. `DeviceGraphOrchestrator`
  records the most recent per-request forward lengths, maps padded hidden rows
  as `request * padded_seq_len + actual_len - 1`, and uses the existing
  graph-native `HiddenStateRowsSelectStage` to gather those rows into
  `PREFIX_TERMINAL_HIDDEN`. The old multi-token batched rejection test is now a
  positive variable-length regression. Focused gates:
  `V2_Unit_MTPGraphConstruction` and the bounded Phase 8 request-batch cluster.
- `DeviceGraphOrchestrator` now exposes a real request-batched greedy MTP
  sidecar draft producer through `forwardMTPBatchAndSampleGreedy()`. The graph
  runs as `seq_len=1, batch_size=request_batch` instead of looping scalar
  sidecars, requires per-request positions, and projects every compact
  `MTP_HIDDEN` row into `MTP_LOGITS` by setting the MTP sidecar LM head to
  `compute_all_positions=true`. The focused regression proves two request rows
  produce finite hidden/logit rows and valid draft tokens; shifted-prefill
  single-request multi-token catchup remains separately covered by exact perf
  tags. Focused gates: `V2_Unit_MTPGraphConstruction` and the bounded Phase 8
  unit cluster.
- Live SingleDevice greedy request-batched continuation is now wired for
  depths 1, 2, and 3. `decodeStepBatch()` builds per-request sidecar condition rows from
  the already-emitted prompt-logit tokens, runs one true batched sidecar draft,
  then batched chained sidecar drafts for deeper fixed depths, schedules an
  owned greedy verifier batch, publishes the returned `MTPSpecStepPlanBatch`
  atomically, advances each request's sequence length, and returns only the
  newly committed suffix so the first token is not emitted twice. The next
  ready bonus token is cached per request and consumed without another verifier
  forward. `supportsDecodeStepBatch()` now advertises the same d1/d2/d3 greedy
  capability the live path executes, and request-batch states own independent
  sampler histories used by the stochastic continuation described below.
  Focused gates:
  `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition`, `V2_Unit_MTPGraphConstruction`, and the
  bounded Phase 8 unit cluster.
- Live SingleDevice stochastic request-batched continuation now executes the
  bounded vLLM-style path for depth 1 through 3. It reuses the true batched
  greedy sidecar draft producer, runs one padded target verifier forward for
  the scheduled request batch, then reduces each request's compact stochastic
  outcome through runner-owned device draft slots and the shared
  `MTPSpecTransactionDriver` publication contract. Each request owns an
  independent sampler, including the bonus-token sampler commit when the device
  summary reports a sampled terminal token, so seeded stochastic rows keep the
  same per-request semantics as scalar decode. Compact stochastic reduction is
  still delegated to the single-request reducer today, but the
  scheduler/owner/publication transaction is already batched. Focused gates:
  `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition` and the bounded Phase 8 unit cluster
  (`V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition`, `V2_Unit_BenchmarkRunnerCPU`,
  `V2_Unit_MTPVerifierForwardExecutor`, `V2_Unit_MTPSpecRequestBatchOwner`,
  `V2_Unit_MTPSpecRequestBatchScheduler`, `V2_Unit_MTPSpecStateContract`,
  `V2_Unit_MTPRejectionSampler`, and `V2_Unit_MTPGraphConstruction`).
- Stochastic request-batch scratch now scales from the runtime MTP capacity
  instead of the scalar four-target/three-draft shape. GPU runners allocate
  target/bonus rows as `max(4, max_request_batch * (draft_tokens + 1))`,
  draft sample rows as `max(3, max_request_batch * draft_tokens)`, per-request
  reduced output rows as `[max_request_batch, output_fields]`, and matching
  top-k partial scratch through the arena. `decodeStepBatch()` maps target and
  bonus slots to compact verifier rows, while draft slots are packed without
  bonus gaps. Focused regressions prove a two-request depth-two stochastic
  batch uses target slots `0/3`, bonus slots `2/5`, and draft slots `0/2`
  rather than clobbering slot zero, and a GPU-gated arena-shape guard proves
  two-request depth-three scratch allocates 8 target slots, 6 draft slots, and
  two compact output rows. The implementation still reduces stochastic
  summaries once per request; the next slice should add a single multi-request
  summary/reduction kernel before benchmark acceptance. Focused gate:
  `V2_Unit_MTPGraphConstruction` and the bounded Phase 8 unit cluster.
- Stochastic request-batch outcome handoff is now atomic at the runner
  contract. `DeviceStochasticBatchOutcomeRequest` value-owns thresholds,
  stop tokens, slot coordinates, bonus rows, and vLLM rejection RNG metadata;
  `decodeStepBatch()` builds/stages every scheduled request first, then calls
  `verifyStochasticDistributionsRequestBatchOutcomesOnDevice()` once. The
  mock regression proves one runner-level outcome call for a two-request
  depth-two batch while retaining target slots `0/3`, bonus slots `2/5`, and
  draft slots `0/2`. The default runner implementation delegates to the
  existing single-request reducer, while GPU runners can override the same
  contract with compact batched output rows. Focused gate: bounded Phase 8
  unit cluster.
- `DeviceGraphOrchestrator` now overrides that request-batch handoff with a
  compact GPU path. It consumes the pending verifier stream once, enqueues each
  request's verifier, bonus sampler, and existing summary reducer into a
  distinct `[request, fields]` arena row, then performs one compact D2H copy
  for all request outcomes. This removes the repeated per-request stream drain
  while preserving the proven CUDA/ROCm summary kernels; a fused backend
  multi-request summary launch is now a benchmark-driven follow-up rather than
  a correctness prerequisite. Focused gate: bounded Phase 8 unit cluster.
- Request-batched GPU prefill and verifier metadata now share the compact row
  upload machinery without confusing their state machines. GPU prefill records
  direct terminal graph rows for compact request-batch sampling, while MTP
  verifier forwards keep using the explicit logical verifier-row plan. This
  fixed the CUDA MoE stochastic RB=2 smoke failure where a prefill row-indexed
  graph tried to consume a nonexistent MTP row plan. Focused gates:
  `V2_Unit_MTPSpecDecodeMetadata`,
  `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition`, and the bounded Phase 8 unit cluster.
- Request-batched stochastic verifier forward now distinguishes ordinary
  request-batched prefill from all-position verifier continuation before
  setting compact terminal-logit row metadata. This avoids the old hard failure
  when `forward_batch()` was called under `compute_all_position_logits=true`
  for the verifier. Focused gate: bounded Phase 8 unit cluster.
- Qwen3.5/Qwen3.6 GDN and short-conv state-capture rows now scale through
  `resolveMTPMaxTargetQueryRows(config.mtp)` instead of `draft_tokens + 1`.
  Multi-request verifier graphs therefore declare enough recurrence capture
  rows for flattened request batches such as RB=2/d1 and RB=2/d3. Focused
  gate: `V2_Unit_MTPGraphConstruction`.
- Mixed stochastic request batches now stay lockstep when one lane accepts all
  drafts and another rejects. The all-accepted lane emits its bonus-ready token
  inline but does not publish bonus recurrent/KV state; the next verifier step
  consumes that token as the condition from the accepted-prefix state, matching
  the existing deferred-ready contract without leaving half the batch in
  terminal-prefill sampling. Regression:
  `RequestBatchedStochasticMixedReadyAndRejectStaysLockstep`.
- The first real CUDA MoE stochastic request-batched benchmark smoke is green:
  `llaminar2 benchmark -m Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-UD-IQ3_S.gguf -d cuda:0
  --n-predict 16 --seed 123 --mtp --mtp-draft-tokens 1
  --mtp-depth-policy fixed --mtp-verify-mode speculative-sampling
  --mtp-max-request-batch 2 -c 4096` completed with 74.38 tok/s decode,
  14 accepted tokens, 76 rejected tokens, 90 verifier runs, and zero rollbacks.
  This proves the functional Phase 8 path for CUDA RB=2 stochastic; acceptance
  remains open until CUDA/ROCm request-batch matrices show MoE stochastic
  speedup against same-run scalar baselines.
- ROCm MoE request-batched stochastic now reaches the same functional point.
  Root cause of the previous warmup failure was a backend route gap: MTP
  request batching enters the small-M verifier router with BF16 gate weights,
  but ROCm's small-M route only accepted FP32. `ROCmMoEKernel` now dispatches
  small-M router rows for FP32, FP16, and BF16 through explicit-stream HIP
  wrappers. Regressions
  `SmallMBF16GateLogits_ModelShapeMatchesSingleTokenLaunches` and
  `SmallMBF16FusedRouter_VerifierShapeRunsWithTensorGate` prove BF16 small-M
  logits match the existing scalar BF16 path and that `routeWithTensors()` uses
  the dtype-aware small-M path. Focused `V2_Integration_ROCmMoEKernel` passes.
  The real ROCm smoke
  `llaminar2 benchmark -m Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-UD-IQ3_S.gguf -d rocm:0
  --n-predict 16 --seed 123 --mtp --mtp-draft-tokens 1
  --mtp-depth-policy fixed --mtp-verify-mode speculative-sampling
  --mtp-max-request-batch 2 -c 4096` completed with 49.53 tok/s decode,
  9 accepted tokens, 81 rejected tokens, 90 verifier runs, and zero rollbacks.
  That makes RB=2 stochastic functionally green on CUDA and ROCm, but Phase 8
  remains performance-red: both backends are slower than scalar/no-MTP
  baselines, and RB=2 acceptance is much lower than the scalar seeded lane.
- Request-batched stochastic terminal-prefill sampling now uses the same
  vLLM-style logical-position threshold contract as scalar MTP. The old GPU
  path sampled compact prefill rows through the backend RNG counter, so
  CUDA MoE RB=2 could choose a different first token than scalar MTP even when
  row logits were identical. `OrchestrationRunner::decodeStepBatch()` now
  computes per-request thresholds from each request sampler and logical
  position, and `DeviceGraphOrchestrator::sampleMainLogitsBatchRowsOnDevice()`
  builds compact top-k/top-p rows before sampling on the explicit GPU stream.
  Regression `RequestBatchedStochasticGpuPrefillUsesPositionKeyedThresholds`
  covers the handoff. Fresh evidence in
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260613T_phase8_rb2_stochastic_prefill_fix/`
  shows scalar CUDA MoE stochastic `-n1` and RB=2 `-n1` both generate token
  `[271]`. CUDA/RB=2 and ROCm/RB=2 MoE stochastic `-n16` both pass with
  12 accepted, 78 rejected, and zero rollbacks at 75.90/52.12 tok/s. Same-run
  scalar d1 is 88.18/56.47 tok/s and no-MTP is 115.32/69.79 tok/s, so the
  remaining Phase 8 blocker is batching policy/transaction economics, not
  prefill-row stochastic correctness.
- Request-batched RoPE metadata is now graph-capture safe on CUDA and ROCm.
  `RoPEStage` owns its kernel instance because stream/workspace/dynamic-position
  validity is graph-node local, and `prepareGraphLaunch()` uploads either the
  scalar pos-offset buffer or explicit position-row buffer before capture/replay.
  CUDA/ROCm kernels now honor explicit position IDs as row-buffer data even when
  the current values are numerically contiguous, preventing accidental fallback
  to stale scalar metadata. Regression
  `V2_Integration_(CUDA|ROCm)RoPEGraphCaptureNoH2D` covers scalar and explicit
  row replay. The real ROCm Qwen3.6 MoE RB=2 greedy smoke
  `llaminar2 benchmark -m Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-UD-IQ3_S.gguf -d rocm:0
  --mtp --mtp-draft-tokens 1 --mtp-max-request-batch 2 --mtp-verify-mode
  greedy -t 0 --n-predict 16` completed without `MTP0_rope` segmented-capture
  fallback at 69.29 tok/s, 13 accepted, 75 rejected, and zero rollbacks.

Exit gate:

- MoE CPU/CUDA/ROCm greedy and stochastic parity passes with the same tests as
  dense plus MoE layer-by-layer math analysis.
- MoE bounded matrix is speed-positive for greedy and stochastic or has a
  measured route/acceptance bottleneck.
- No MoE path uses dense-only fallbacks.

Closure status:

- Feature/correctness gate closed on 2026-06-13 for SingleDevice
  CPU/CUDA/ROCm dense and MoE. Request-batched stochastic MoE is now covered
  by the shared vLLM-style transaction path and by CUDA/ROCm real-model RB=2
  smokes with zero rollbacks.
- Performance gate remains red and moves to the tuning dashboard: MoE
  stochastic request batching currently lowers acceptance versus scalar on
  the default prompt, and scalar MoE stochastic is still slower than no-MTP.
  Future work should tune batching policy, verifier/condition transaction
  amortization, and MoE stochastic economics without changing the Phase 8
  correctness contract.

### Phase 9: Multi-Device Promotion

Goal: extend the accepted SingleDevice contract to TP/PP/ExpertParallel without
changing its semantics.

Work:

- LocalTP/GlobalTP participants share the same draft tokens, target rows,
  accepted counts, and rollback/publication decision.
- PP stages publish only their local layer state but agree on global accepted
  token counts.
- ExpertParallel participants execute sparse no-op/dispatch/return stages in a
  symmetric sequence, with placement fingerprints included in prefix/MTP state.

Status:

- First CPU/unit slice landed the shared common-prefix contract:
  `coordinateMTPSpecCommonAcceptedPrefix()` clamps participant-local
  `MTPSpecStepPlan` publication to the minimum accepted state count and marks
  divergent participants as requiring common fallback replay. This gives
  LocalTP, GlobalTP/NodeLocalTP, LocalPP, and ExpertParallel one reusable rule:
  no participant may publish verifier state past the common accepted prefix.
  Focused gate: `V2_Unit_MTPSpecStateContract`.
- LocalTP runtime fan-out now exists for accepted spec-state publication.
  `RankOrchestrator::supportsMTPSpecStatePublication()` only advertises the
  capability when every child runner supports it, and
  `publishAcceptedMTPSpecState()` coordinates the plan through the shared
  common-prefix helper before publishing on every child via the TP worker pool.
  A failed or unsupported participant fails the rank operation instead of
  silently publishing a partial topology. Focused gate:
  `V2_Unit_RankOrchestrator`; bounded MTP gate:
  `V2_Unit_(RankOrchestrator|MTPSpecStateContract|MTPSpecDecodeMetadata|MTPSpecDecodeTransaction|MTPDecodeCatchup|MTPRejectionSampler|MTPVerifierPolicy|GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy|PrefillDecodeTransition)`.
- LocalTP chained sidecar drafts are no longer single-child only.
  `RankOrchestrator::supportsChainedMTPDrafts()` now requires every child to
  support depth-2/3 sidecar chaining, and `forwardMTPFromLastDraft()` fans the
  same draft token plus shifted-cache position to every participant through the
  TP worker pool. This makes fixed d2/d3 LocalTP MTP reachable under the same
  all-child hard-fail contract as rank-level publication. Focused gate:
  `V2_Unit_RankOrchestrator`; bounded MTP gate same as above.
- LocalTP shifted-prefill MTP embedding now follows the vocab-parallel contract
  on CUDA/ROCm. `EmbeddingStage` passes both the local vocab range and the
  "out-of-shard rows may be zero" permission to the GPU embedding kernels, so
  device-token validation no longer mistakes an in-process LocalTP shard for a
  broken single-device embedding. This also makes FP32 GPU embedding launches
  respect explicit vocab offsets. Focused gates:
  `V2_Unit_VocabParallelEmbeddingSharding`,
  `V2_Unit_EmbeddingStage_GraphCapture`, and
  `V2_Integration_Parity_Qwen36_LocalTP_Qwen36LocalTPPrefixMTPParity_MTPGreedyMatchesPyTorchDecodeTokens`.
- LocalTP dynamic depth is now enabled through the same rank-wide
  `OrchestrationRunner` controller used by SingleDevice. The controller chooses
  one draft depth for the request step and `RankOrchestrator` fans that depth
  out to every child, so participants do not adapt independently. PP and
  GlobalTP/MPI remain hard-gated until they have explicit scalar depth
  coordination. Focused gates: `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition`,
  `V2_Integration_Parity_Qwen36_LocalTP_Qwen36LocalTPPrefixMTPParity_MTPGreedyDepth3MatchesPyTorchDecodeTokens`,
  and
  `V2_Integration_Parity_Qwen36_LocalTP_Qwen36LocalTPPrefixMTPParity_MTPGreedyDynamicDepthMatchesPyTorchDecodeTokens`.
- NodeLocalTP fixed d2/d3 MTP now uses the same all-participant chained
  sidecar contract. `GlobalOrchestrator` advertises chained draft support only
  when every stage runner supports it, and `forwardMTPFromLastDraft()` fans the
  same draft token plus shifted position to every rank-local participant.
  Dynamic depth now broadcasts rank 0's scalar controller decision before each
  step so all ranks execute the same sidecar/verifier shape. Focused gates:
  `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition`,
  `V2_Integration_Parity_Qwen36_NodeLocalTP_Qwen36NodeLocalTPPrefixParity_MTPGreedyDepth3MatchesPyTorchDecodeTokens`,
  `V2_Integration_Parity_Qwen36_NodeLocalTP_Qwen36NodeLocalTPPrefixParity_MTPGreedyDynamicDepthMatchesPyTorchDecodeTokens`,
  and full `V2_Integration_Parity_Qwen36_NodeLocalTP_`, which is green for
  five real-model tests plus fixture after this slice.
- LocalTP all-position verifier sampling now consumes the verifier graph replay
  stream exactly once per child runner and reuses that handoff for every sampled
  verifier row. This closes the race where LocalTP could sample row logits on a
  child default stream before a graph-captured verifier replay had completed.
  Focused gate: `V2_Unit_RankOrchestrator`.
- ExpertOverlay Qwen3.6 MoE parity now covers ROCm2TP-hot plus CPU2LocalTP-cold
  greedy MTP and prefix-restore MTP. The fixed causes were missing ROCm
  local-expert nested workspace declarations and GPU MoE parity not enabling the
  deterministic reduction-order mode on ROCm near-tie prompts. Focused gates:
  `V2_Unit_MoELocalExpertStage_PreparedWeights`,
  `V2_Unit_RankOrchestrator`, and full
  `^V2_Integration_Parity_Qwen36MoE_ExpertOverlay_`.
- The tuning dashboard now tracks SingleDevice, LocalTP, LocalPP, NodeLocalTP,
  and ExpertOverlay separately for implementation, parity, and benchmark state.
  LocalPP fixed-depth dense MTP is now implemented through a final-stage
  sidecar delegation path: the terminal PP stage receives shifted-prefill
  tokens, owns the MTP sidecar weights plus embedding table, and builds MTP KV
  append/attention with cache-local sidecar layer ids instead of subtracting
  the main PP offset. Non-terminal PP stages reject sidecar weights. Dynamic
  depth is enabled through the same central `OrchestrationRunner` controller as
  SingleDevice/LocalTP, so PP stages do not adapt independently. LocalPP
  all-position publication is now implemented as an all-stage contract:
  non-final stages publish verifier main KV/GDN state only, while the final
  stage owns logits, stochastic device outcome verification, terminal-hidden
  row selection, and shifted sidecar KV publication. Device-token handoff
  remains gated for PP because verifier token input starts at stage 0 while
  final-stage sampler slots live on the pipeline tail. Focused gates:
  `V2_Unit_WeightManagerPPSafety`, `V2_Unit_RankOrchestrator`,
  `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition`, and full
  `^V2_Integration_Parity_Qwen36_LocalPP_`, which is green for prefix restore,
  fixed d1/d3 MTP, dynamic MTP, stochastic MTP, and prefix+MTP restore.
- The standard benchmark matrix runner now has an explicit topology axis and a
  leading `topology` summary column. `single` remains the default; opt-in
  presets generate the tested command shapes for `localtp_rocm2`,
  `localtp_cuda2`, `localpp_rocm2`, `nodelocaltp_cpu2`,
  `expert_overlay_rocm2_hot`, and `expert_overlay_rocm2_cpu2`. The script
  fails fast for unsupported model/topology pairings so multi-device evidence
  cannot accidentally mix dense-only and MoE-only lanes. Regression:
  `V2_Unit_MTPIterationBenchmarkMatrix`.
- The matrix runner now exposes `--gpu-stage-timing`, which requires
  `--perfstats` and sets `LLAMINAR_PERF_STATS_GPU_STAGE_TIMING=1` for MTP
  perfstats rows. Use this for bounded diagnostics when CUDA/ROCm MoE aggregate
  timers hide graph-stage GPU work behind deferred sync points. Runs now also
  emit `stage_summary.tsv`, ranking decode-domain `mtp` and `stage_gpu` timers
  per topology/device/model/mode/variant so Phase 8 and Phase 9 tuning evidence
  stays comparable across SingleDevice, TP, PP, and ExpertOverlay lanes.
  Regression: `V2_Unit_MTPIterationBenchmarkMatrix`.
- Greedy compact device-outcome verification is now an explicit runner
  capability rather than a GPU-wide assumption. Single-device and final-stage
  PP runners may use the compact path; multi-child LocalTP uses the existing
  sharded verifier-row sampler until a true cross-participant compact reducer
  exists. This keeps LocalTP from hard-failing inside an unsupported compact
  verifier while preserving the topology-hard-fail contract for genuinely
  advertised capabilities. Focused gates: `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition`
  and `V2_Unit_RankOrchestrator`. Fresh ROCm topology smoke
  `20260612T232547Z-rocm-topology-dense-greedy-smoke-capability-fix` is green:
  LocalTP d1 accepted 12/12 at 34.4 vs 36.7 tok/s, and LocalPP d1 accepted
  12/12 at 40.9 vs 31.4 tok/s.
- Fresh bounded ROCm dense greedy topology matrix
  `20260612T234446Z-iteration-matrix-3ed9c37e` is green with same-run
  baseline/fixed/dynamic evidence. LocalTP ROCm2: baseline 34.1 tok/s, d1 34.6
  (1.01x), d2 34.3 (1.00x, 80% acceptance), d3 55.4 (1.62x), dynamic 54.2
  (1.59x). LocalPP ROCm2: baseline 30.3 tok/s, d1 44.0 (1.45x), d2 39.8
  (1.32x, 80% acceptance), d3 55.5 (1.83x), dynamic 62.9 (2.08x). All MTP
  lanes completed with zero rollbacks; stage timing shows the remaining cost is
  verifier graph replay and sidecar work, not publication failure.

Exit gate:

- LocalTP, NodeLocalTP, LocalPP, and ExpertParallel parity suites pass for dense
  and MoE where hardware exists.
- Multi-device MTP never lets one participant publish a longer prefix than the
  common accepted count.

Closure status:

- Feature/correctness gate closed on 2026-06-13 for the recorded Phase 9
  topology set. Dense LocalTP, LocalPP, and NodeLocalTP parity suites are
  present and previously recorded green; ExpertOverlay MoE parity is recorded
  green for ROCm2TP-hot plus CPU2LocalTP-cold. The focused Phase 9 unit guard
  `V2_Unit_(RankOrchestrator|MTPIterationBenchmarkMatrix|MTPSpecStateContract|PrefillDecodeTransition)`
  passed after rebuilding the interface-dependent multi-device test binary.
- Performance/tuning remains dashboard-owned. ROCm dense LocalTP/LocalPP
  lanes are already speed-positive, while NodeLocalTP and ExpertOverlay
  benchmark presets still need refreshed same-run matrices before any rollout
  claim.

### Phase 9.5: Device-Owned Live-State Cleanup

Goal: remove split host/device ownership from the MTP hot path so verifier
publication, replay, and graph rebuilds cannot observe incoherent GDN, KV, or
logical sequence state. Host mirrors are allowed for diagnostics, snapshots,
prefix-cache serialization, and response materialization, but they must not be
the source of truth for GPU state mutation or graph-captured inference.

Why this phase exists:

- The CUDA Qwen3.6 MoE published-state regression was a coherence bug, not a
  verifier-math bug: GDN and short-conv verifier publication restored the
  backend-owned device state but left hybrid host mirrors stale, and a later
  graph rebuild could resume from the stale host state.
- Similar split-ownership hazards remain in KV ring head/count mirrors,
  `DeviceGraphOrchestrator` logical positions/sequence lengths, MTP compact
  transaction metadata, and MoE sidecar router/expert replay metadata.
- Phase 10 performance work depends on keeping the host out of the live-state
  mutation boundary. Tuning around hidden host dependencies risks preserving
  the wrong architecture.

Work:

- Inventory every live-state surface with both host and device representations:
  GDN recurrence, short-conv history, main KV ring state, shifted MTP KV ring
  state, logical positions, sequence lengths, terminal hidden/logits, compact
  stochastic outcomes, next-condition tokens, and MoE routed/shared expert
  metadata.
- Declare one owner per surface in GPU mode. Device-owned surfaces expose typed
  handles, explicit producer streams, readiness events, and validity epochs.
  Host mirrors expose explicit adoption/flush APIs and are marked stale until
  adoption succeeds.
- Replace ad hoc D2H mirror refreshes in state-publication code with
  device-owned publication followed by optional host adoption. Adoption must
  never be required before the next graph-captured state mutation.
- Add poison-mirror regression tests: publish on device, deliberately corrupt
  the corresponding host mirror, force the graph rebuild/replay path under
  test, and prove output/state remains decode-equivalent. These tests should
  exist first for CUDA/ROCm GDN and KV, then for DGO logical state, then for MoE
  sidecar metadata.
- Extend the hygiene guards so new GPU stages cannot introduce unsanctioned
  live-state host ownership, default/null streams, direct tensor
  `ensureOnDevice()` hot-path transfers, or raw CUDA/HIP allocations outside
  workspace/back-end infrastructure.
- Keep CPU on host-owned implementations for now, but use the same typed state
  contracts so CPU can later gain a device-like mailbox abstraction without
  changing runner logic.

Exit gate:

- CUDA and ROCm GDN/short-conv publication tests prove accepted-row device
  restore and host-mirror adoption independently.
- CUDA and ROCm KV publication tests prove device head/count metadata remains
  authoritative across append, truncate, prefix restore, resident MTP
  publication, and graph replay.
- DGO logical-state tests prove `get_position()`/`sequence_lengths()` are never
  read for GPU MTP planning while a resident mailbox is newer than the adopted
  host mirror.
- MoE sidecar preservation is promoted only after a dedicated replay
  equivalence test covers router metadata, routed/shared expert scratch,
  shifted MTP KV, terminal hidden, and accepted-state publication.
- Phase 10 benchmarks report no state-mutation dependency on compact outcome
  D2H. Remaining host work must be response/output flushing or diagnostics.

Current status:

- Closed on the focused Phase 9.5 gate. CUDA and ROCm GDN/short-conv
  publication tests prove accepted verifier rows restore backend device state
  and refresh host mirrors before graph rebuild.
- CUDA and ROCm KV publication tests now prove device head/count metadata is
  authoritative: publishing accepted resident state updates device metadata
  while host mirrors stay stale until explicit adoption.
- CUDA and ROCm hybrid KV caches now use the same compressed full-attention
  layer mapping for payload, host metadata, and device-owned head/count
  pointers. The regression uses an offset map where global FA layer 3 maps to
  compressed slot 0 while parent slot 3 still exists, proving the device
  metadata path cannot silently read a valid but wrong slot. Legacy null-stream
  direct append now resolves to the backend's explicit worker stream outside
  graph capture so the payload append and device metadata upload stay ordered;
  capture-time append without an explicit stream hard-fails.
- DGO resident shifted-row commits now hard-fail without a device-derived
  `position_offset_override`. The structural guard proves this resident path
  cannot derive commit positions from `state_.positions`, `get_position()`, or
  other stale host mirrors.
- The focused split backend gate passed on 2026-06-16. CUDA may skip ROCm
  startup, but ROCm must run with normal AMD backend registration:

```bash
cmake --build build_v2_integration --parallel
LLAMINAR_LOG_LEVEL=ERROR LLAMINAR_SKIP_ROCM_STARTUP=1 \
ctest --test-dir build_v2_integration \
  -R '^(V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy|V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition)$' \
  --output-on-failure --parallel --timeout 300
LLAMINAR_LOG_LEVEL=ERROR LLAMINAR_SKIP_ROCM_STARTUP=1 \
ctest --test-dir build_v2_integration \
  -R '^(V2_Integration_CUDARingKVCacheParity|V2_Integration_CUDAHybridKVCacheReset|V2_Integration_Parity_Qwen35_SingleDevice_Qwen35_Qwen35SingleDeviceParityTest_DecodeParity_Qwen35_4B_CUDA_KV_FP16)$' \
  --output-on-failure --parallel --timeout 300
LLAMINAR_LOG_LEVEL=ERROR \
ctest --test-dir build_v2_integration \
  -R '^(V2_Integration_ROCmRingKVCache|V2_Integration_ROCmHybridKVCacheReset|V2_Integration_Parity_Qwen35_SingleDevice_Qwen35_Qwen35SingleDeviceParityTest_DecodeParity_Qwen35_4B_ROCm_KV_FP16)$' \
  --output-on-failure --parallel --timeout 300
```

- MoE persistent sidecar metadata, compact outcome hostlessness, and
  graph-captured resident transaction consumption remain Phase 10 performance
  work. Phase 9.5's role is complete: stale host mirrors are no longer allowed
  to be implicit sources of truth for the covered live-state handoffs.

### Phase 9.6: Persistent MoE Sidecar Metadata

Goal: give MoE MTP sidecars vLLM-style persistent runtime metadata with stable
graph-captured addresses. This phase removes shared/transient MoE routing
metadata from the sidecar path and keeps the production capability boundary
honest: MoE direct all-position live-state publication remains disabled until
its verifier rows are proven serial-equivalent on each backend.

Why this phase exists:

- Phase 9.5 made live-state ownership explicit, but Phase 10 profiling still
  shows MoE sidecars depending on router/expert metadata whose ownership is
  hard to reason about under graph replay.
- vLLM keeps speculative decode metadata in persistent device-side structures
  with stable addresses. Llaminar must do the same for MoE routing/expert
  metadata so graph replay does not depend on transient host vectors or shared
  main-decode route slots.
- MoE sidecar graph replay safety is narrower than sidecar main-state
  preservation. The sidecar may own persistent metadata without claiming that
  the all-position verifier can publish live KV/GDN state.
- A focused CUDA/ROCm investigation found that MoE all-position verifier rows
  are not yet serial-equivalent for this fixture, so direct MoE publication is
  explicitly outside Phase 9.6 acceptance.

Implementation plan:

1. Give every Qwen3.6 MoE MTP sidecar depth its own persistent
   `MoERuntimeTable`, even when the logical layer index aliases a main-model
   layer. Runtime-table keys must be depth-scoped and must not feed decode
   histograms.
2. Keep MoE graph buffers arena/workspace owned: routing indices, routing
   weights, grouped expert metadata, shared-expert scratch, and prefill scratch
   must have stable graph-facing addresses.
3. Keep sidecar replay-safety contracts separate from direct live-state
   publication. Persistent sidecar metadata may be used by captured sidecar
   graphs, but MoE must not advertise `supportsMTPSpecStatePublication()` until
   all-position verifier rows are serial-equivalent.
4. Do not broaden `supportsMTPSidecarPreservesMainState()` or
   `supportsMTPShiftedRowReuseFromSidecar()` for MoE in this phase. MoE still
   restores verifier base state and commits accepted shifted rows through the
   verifier publication path.
5. Add structural guards proving MoE sidecar runtime tables are depth-scoped and
   replay preservation is not tied to the dense shifted-row shortcut.
6. Add real-model integration coverage proving Qwen3.6 MoE MTP creates or
   reuses depth-scoped sidecar runtime tables, remains token-correct, and stays
   off the direct all-position publication path while that verifier is red.
7. Update dashboard evidence only after the focused Phase 9.6 gate passes.

Acceptance gate:

```bash
cmake --build build_v2_integration --parallel
ctest --test-dir build_v2_integration \
  -R '^(V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy|V2_Integration_Parity_Qwen36MoE_(CUDA|ROCm)_SingleDevice_.*MTPBenchmarkStyleUsesPersistentMoESidecarMetadata)$' \
  --output-on-failure --parallel
```

Exit criteria:

- MoE MTP sidecar graphs use persistent depth-scoped runtime metadata.
- MoE does not opt into dense shifted-row reuse or sidecar main-state
  preservation unless a separate equivalence proof lands.
- MoE direct all-position state publication is disabled until verifier rows are
  serial-equivalent; integration tests prove the Phase 9.6 metadata path without
  exercising that broken publication shortcut.
- CUDA and ROCm Qwen3.6 MoE integration tests prove output correctness while
  the sidecar uses persistent metadata.

Current status:

- [x] Planned as a distinct cleanup phase before the next broad gate.
- [x] Initial code slice gives MTP MoE sidecars depth-scoped runtime tables and
  keeps sidecar metadata out of main-decode runtime slots.
- [x] Capability correction keeps MoE direct all-position publication disabled
  until verifier-row parity proves it.
- [x] Structural guards updated and passing.
- [x] Real-model CUDA/ROCm integration tests proving persistent sidecar
  metadata are added and passing.
- [x] Dashboard updated with Phase 9.6 evidence.

Expanded guard evidence:

- `V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy` passed.
- CUDA and ROCm
  `MTPBenchmarkStyleUsesPersistentMoESidecarMetadata` passed.
- The broader reference sweep exposed a CUDA MoE depth-1
  `MTPBenchmarkStyleDepth1EightTokensMatchesReference` failure: live committed
  continuation matched the committed probe, but full replay diverged and the
  shifted MTP KV probe reported `596@596` live versus `594@594` after replay.
  This is not a Phase 9.6 metadata failure; it is the seed blocker for Phase
  9.7's verifier-row decode-equivalence proofs.

### Phase 9.7: Decode-Equivalent Multi-Row Verifier Proofs

Goal: implement and prove CPU, CUDA, and ROCm verifier-row paths that are
decode-equivalent to serial decode for every row count used by production MTP.
No production graph may consume a multi-row verifier state, compact outcome, or
accepted-row publisher until the corresponding backend/model-class proof is
green.

Why this phase exists:

- Phase 9.6 deliberately kept MoE direct all-position state publication off.
  CUDA MoE row publication already showed row-level drift on this fixture, and
  the expanded Phase 9.6 guard found a depth-1 CUDA replay mismatch in the
  decode-equivalent path itself.
- The vLLM-style target architecture is a batched speculative verifier: for
  each request it runs `num_draft_tokens + 1` target rows, indexes draft-token
  logits separately from bonus logits, and lets the sampler consume explicit
  device metadata. Llaminar must prove that each produced verifier row is the
  same state/logit row serial decode would have produced before wiring it into
  the hot graph path.
- Hidden, KV, GDN, MTP shifted KV, positions, sampled logits, router metadata,
  and stochastic acceptance metadata must move together as one verified row
  contract. Partial equivalence is a coherence bug waiting to happen.

Implementation plan:

1. Define `MTPVerifierRowEquivalenceSpec` for dense, hybrid, and MoE models.
   It names backend, model class, draft depth, verifier rows, sampling mode,
   row-selection policy, and the state families that must compare.
2. Add dedicated integration tests before graph promotion:
   - Dense Qwen3.6 CPU/CUDA/ROCm M=1/2/3/4 verifier rows versus serial decode.
   - MoE Qwen3.6 CPU/CUDA/ROCm M=1/2/3/4 verifier rows versus serial decode.
   - Greedy and stochastic tests using the same request seeds and sampling
     params as served inference.
   - Full-row distribution checks, not just sampled-token, top-k, or raw
     argmax checks: raw-logit cosine similarity, raw-logit relative L2, and
     symmetric KL over softmax probabilities must all pass tight thresholds for
     every verifier row before a backend is considered equivalent.
   - Stage snapshots may diagnose the first divergent layer, but they are not
     substitutes for final distribution metrics. A test that only matches the
     sampled token or a handful of logits is red for Phase 9.7.
   - Continuation replay tests that restore or publish row `k`, then decode at
     least four more tokens and compare with a fresh serial runner.
3. Compare all state needed for production:
   - Main KV logical metadata and payload hashes.
   - MTP shifted KV logical metadata and payload hashes.
   - GDN recurrence and short-conv hashes.
   - Terminal hidden and logits, including target-logit and bonus-logit rows.
   - MoE router indices/weights, grouped expert metadata, shared-expert output,
     and persistent sidecar runtime table generation.
   - Position, sequence length, accepted-token count, and sampler RNG state.
4. Keep tests backend-symmetric. If CUDA has a deep proof, ROCm and CPU must
   have the same proof unless explicitly marked unsupported in the dashboard.
5. Implement backend paths only behind a narrow capability object:
   `MTPVerifierRowPublicationCapability`. It reports supported row counts,
   supported sampling modes, supported model classes, and the exact test gate
   that promoted the capability.
6. Wire graph consumers only after proofs pass:
   - Dense direct row publication first.
   - Hybrid GDN row publication second.
   - MoE row publication last, after routed/shared expert rows are serial
     equivalent on CPU/CUDA/ROCm.
7. Preserve the fallback policy while the proof is red: use the shared
   decode-equivalent replay path and fail closed rather than silently enabling
   an unproven fast path.
8. Update the dashboard after each slice with backend/model/sampling RAG,
   failing row count, first mismatch family, and benchmark impact.
9. Treat all-position verifier rows as unaccepted until they pass the strict
   distribution proof. If a batched candidate fails cosine, relative L2, or
   symmetric KL, the accepted implementation for that lane is the row-serial
   decode-equivalent verifier path until a fused/batched replacement proves the
   same metrics against the row-serial oracle.

cmake --build build_v2_integration --parallel
ctest --test-dir build_v2_integration \
  -R '^(V2_Unit_.*MTP.*Verifier|V2_Integration_Parity_Qwen36.*VerifierRowsDecodeEquivalent|V2_Integration_Parity_Qwen36MoE_.*VerifierRowsDecodeEquivalent|V2_Integration_Parity_Qwen36MoE_.*MTPBenchmarkStyleDepth1EightTokensMatchesReference)$' \

  --output-on-failure --parallel
```

Exit criteria:

- CPU, CUDA, and ROCm dense verifier rows M=1/2/3/4 are serial-decode
  equivalent for greedy and stochastic.
- CPU, CUDA, and ROCm MoE verifier rows M=1/2/3/4 are serial-decode equivalent
  for greedy and stochastic.
- The CUDA depth-1 replay mismatch found in Phase 9.6 is fixed and covered by a
  regression.
- Production capability flags name the exact proven row counts; unsupported
  lanes remain fail-closed.
- Dashboard rows show correctness status and benchmark deltas for every
  promoted backend/model/sampling lane.

Current status:

- [x] Phase written from the Phase 9.6 CUDA depth-1 replay failure and current
  vLLM speculative verifier structure.
- [x] Full-distribution proof requirement added: cosine, relative L2, and
  symmetric KL must pass for each verifier row; top-token equality is
  insufficient.
- [ ] Equivalence spec and capability type added.
- [x] Dense CPU/CUDA/ROCm verifier-row tests added and passing for the current
  supported proof paths. CPU grouped all-position covers M=2/3/4; CUDA and
  ROCm dense grouped all-position cover M=1/2/3/4. MoE grouped all-position is
  not part of this green state.
- [x] CPU dense grouped all-position verifier rows M=2/3/4 now pass strict
  full-distribution equivalence against serial decode. The root cause was CPU
  RoPE using the normal contiguous multi-row prefill math inside tiny MTP
  verifier graphs; `RoPEStage` now has an explicit CPU decode-equivalent
  verifier-row mode that row-walks the same one-token RoPE contract as live
  decode. A later M=2 regression was traced to sub-ULP short-conv output drift:
  grouped short-conv now shares the exact serial decode channel/update helper
  and output-store helper while still running one concurrent channel-block pass
  over all verifier rows. Focused guards:
  `ComputeStageTest.RoPEVerifierPrefillMatchesSerialDecodeRows` and
  `Qwen36CPUSingleDevicePrefixMTPParity.VerifierRowsGroupedDecodeEquivalentM[2-4]`;
  `Test__GDNMathematicalCorrectness.ShortConv_GroupedVerifierRowsMatchSerialDecodeAtQwen36ShapeM2ToM4`
  locks the short-conv exactness bug.
- [x] CUDA/ROCm dense grouped all-position verifier rows M=1/2/3/4 now pass
  strict model-level parity. ROCm M=3 previously diverged because GPU
  non-captured verifier rows still used the host row-loop oracle while graph
  capture used device-derived row params; `AttentionComputeStage` now routes
  all GPU verifier rows through the same device-owned multi-row path. Focused
  ROCm attention guards prove raw flash-decode, stage, and captured
  append+attention M=2/3/4 rows match serial decode.
- [x] MoE CPU/CUDA/ROCm M=1/2/3/4 verifier-row tests added and passing for
  the currently supported shared decode-equivalent verifier path. The proof
  runs `runSharedStepwiseMTPDecodeCatchupGreedy()`, captures every verifier
  row's full logit distribution, and compares it with serial replay using
  cosine, relative L2, symmetric KL, sampled-token equality, and four-token
  continuation equality.
- [x] MoE direct all-position production capability remains disabled while
  `supportsMTPSpecStatePublication()` is false for MoE. CUDA/ROCm
  device-resident publication diagnostics now run in the parity suite for the
  decode-equivalent verifier path, while the grouped expert promotion remains
  fail-closed after strict continuation drift.
- [x] CUDA depth-1 MoE replay regression fixed. CUDA runtime MoE pointer
  staging now treats direct stream capture the same as Llaminar graph capture,
  so captured graphs reuse pre-staged scoped pointer slots instead of recording
  stack-backed H2D pointer copies. ROCm uses the same scoped-slot contract.
- [ ] Proven capabilities wired into production graph consumers.
- [x] Dashboard updated with Phase 9.7 correctness and benchmark evidence.

Observed focused results:

- CPU dense M=2,3,4 passed after the RoPE decode-equivalence fix. Standalone
  M3/M4 passed in `117.09s`; the combined M2/M3/M4 proof also passed, but took
  `642.70s`, so Phase 9.8 still treats the CPU grouped proof path as
  correctness-green but performance-suspect.
- CUDA MoE M=1,2,3,4 shared decode-equivalent and grouped verifier rows pass
  strict full-distribution metrics. The earlier grouped M=2 failure was fixed
  by removing verifier-sized cuBLAS FP32 GDN projections from the path.
- ROCm MoE M=1,2,3,4 shared decode-equivalent and grouped verifier rows pass
  strict full-distribution metrics. The earlier grouped M=2 failure was fixed
  by copying route rows from immutable full routing tensors instead of the
  scoped one-row scratch bindings used during single-token replay.
- CPU MoE M=1,2,3,4 passed. M=1 cold load/proof took `209.98s`; warm M=2..4
  took about `29s` each.

### Phase 9.8: Economical Decode-Equivalent Verifier Implementation

Goal: turn the Phase 9.7 decode-equivalence proofs into production-economical
implementations before any Phase 10 default-enablement decision. The verifier
must stay decode-equivalent, but the hot path should no longer pay row-serial
replay, full all-position LM-head, or host transfer/sync costs where a compact
backend-resident path can produce the same state and logits.

Scope:

- CPU, CUDA, and ROCm dense verifier rows M=1/2/3/4.
- CPU, CUDA, and ROCm MoE verifier rows M=1/2/3/4, including routed experts,
  shared expert, final hidden publication, LM-head, sampling, correction-token
  selection, and accepted-state publication.
- SingleDevice first, then sharded LocalTP, NodeLocalTP/GlobalTP, LocalPP, and
  ExpertOverlay. SingleDevice-only reducers are a bootstrap lane, not the final
  Phase 9.8 contract.
- Greedy and stochastic paths. Stochastic promotion requires the same RNG draw
  positions and distribution metrics as the serial decode oracle.
- Fixed d1/d2/d3 paths first. Dynamic-depth policy remains secondary until the
  fixed-depth verifier economics are green.

Why this phase exists:

- Phase 9.7 intentionally proved correctness first. It allowed row-serial
  decode-equivalent replay and host bridges while the row contract was still
  being validated.
- Current MoE publication code still has a decode-equivalent row replay route
  for multi-row verifier prefill. That is the right fail-closed correctness
  posture, but it is not an economical production implementation.
- GPU verifier/sampling work has already moved toward resident outcomes, but
  the remaining D2H/H2D and stream-sync boundaries still show up in perfstats
  and ROCm stage timing. The hot path needs to decide, publish, and continue
  from backend-owned data.
- CPU is correctness-capable but should use the same compact row metadata
  contract and avoid GPU-only optimizations being mirrored as full host-logit
  scans or all-position target work.

Implementation plan:

1. Capability contract
   - Add or extend a verifier-economy capability record, alongside the Phase 9.7
     correctness capability, with explicit fields for:
     `device_resident_input`, `device_resident_outcome`,
     `device_resident_publication`, `grouped_decode_equivalent`,
     `row_indexed_lm_head`, `host_bridge_free_hot_path`, `graph_capturable`,
     `supported_rows`, `supported_sampling_modes`, and `perf_gate_status`.
   - Capabilities must distinguish "serial decode-equivalent fallback" from
     "grouped decode-equivalent implementation". Both can be correct; only the
     grouped path can satisfy this phase's performance gate.
   - Dashboard/perfstats rows must print the active verifier path, grouped
     support, row-indexed LM-head support, host-bridge hot-path status, and the
     exact row counts proven per backend/model/sampling lane.

2. Fully resident GPU transaction boundary
   - Keep draft tokens, verifier input rows, accepted counts, correction/bonus
     token choice, output-token metadata, terminal-hidden selection, and next
     condition token in backend-owned buffers until the state update is
     complete.
   - Remove remaining H2D uploads of compact verifier rows in CUDA/ROCm greedy
     and stochastic paths. Sidecar sampling should publish draft token rows
     directly into the verifier mailbox/arena.
   - Remove hot-path D2H dependencies from stochastic outcome and publication.
     A host-readable outcome bridge may remain only as an output materialization
     or diagnostic path after the publication-safe event.
   - Request-batched stochastic lanes need the same resident boundary as the
     scalar lane. The compact outcome reducer may already produce a
     `DeviceSpeculativeOutcomeHandle`, but publication is not complete until
     recurrent/short-conv state can restore from a batch of device row indices,
     not only one scalar accepted-row pointer. Until that batch restore contract
     exists, request-batched lanes must remain marked host-transaction-bound and
     must not quietly advertise resident publication support.
   - Perfstats must expose hot-path H2D/D2H byte counts and sync counts. The
     target value for CUDA/ROCm verifier transaction decisions is zero, excluding
     explicit final response materialization.
   - All CUDA/HIP work must use explicit non-null streams, reusable workspace,
     and graph-capturable operations. No default-stream timing or per-iteration
     allocation is allowed in a promoted path.
   - SingleDevice full-vocabulary reducers must not be mistaken for TP support.
     Vocab-sharded LocalTP and GlobalTP need a collective-aware compact outcome
     reducer that computes row argmax/top-k/top-p/probability acceptance across
     shards before publication. Until that reducer exists, TP lanes must
     fail-closed or use the explicitly labelled serial decode-equivalent path;
     they must not sample from participant 0 or silently downgrade to a local
     full-vocab assumption.

3. CPU compact verifier path
   - Bring CPU up to the same contract shape as GPU: compact verifier metadata,
     row-indexed hidden selection, row-indexed target/bonus LM-head, sampled
     output metadata, and accepted-state publication.
   - Avoid full all-position LM-head and host-logit scans when the verifier only
     needs draft rows plus the bonus/correction row.
   - Avoid per-row virtual stage replay for M=2/3/4 once the grouped CPU path is
     proven. Use cache-friendly row blocks and existing NativeVNNI/top-k CPU
     fast paths where they apply.
   - CPU stochastic sampling must keep using shared `SamplingMath` semantics so
     CPU remains the readable oracle for GPU-focused failures.

4. Performant grouped multi-row verifier
   - Dense: implement a batched row-indexed verifier path for M=2/3/4 that
     produces the same logits, sampled tokens, accepted-state rows, and
     continuation state as serial decode.
   - Every verifier stage on the promoted path must be grouped/concurrent:
     RoPE, KV append, attention, GDN recurrence, short-conv, dense
     projections, LM-head, MoE routing, routed experts, shared experts,
     sampling, and accepted-state publication. A helper that loops over M
     ordinary one-token stage executions is a correctness oracle only; it must
     stay labelled `serial_decode_equivalent_fallback` and cannot satisfy
     Phase 9.8 performance acceptance.
   - MoE: replace promoted uses of `executeDecodeEquivalentVerifierPrefill`
     row replay with grouped decode-equivalent routed+shared prefill for
     M=2/3/4. Serial replay remains available only as a guarded fallback.
   - CUDA: tune grouped verifier prefill with explicit stream capture, reusable
     descriptor tables/workspace, row-indexed LM-head, and tile/dispatch choices
     trained or measured for the actual Qwen3.5/3.6 verifier buckets.
   - ROCm: tune M=2/3/4 grouped verifier buckets with `rocprof` per-dispatch
     evidence, explicit HIP streams, graph-capturable grouping/prefill, and no
     producer-drain sync masquerading as a compact D2H cost.
   - CPU: provide a batched decode-equivalent verifier path with the same
     strict distribution proof and enough instrumentation to identify row
     grouping, LM-head, sampler, and publication cost separately.
   - Trained M=2/3/4 kernels are part of this phase, not a follow-up.  The
     row-wise M=1 verifier path is the correctness fallback contract; Phase 9.8
     is not performance-complete until CPU, CUDA, and ROCm have generated or
     trained dispatch tables for verifier-shaped GEMV/GEMM buckets and the
     promoted kernels are wired into dense, GDN, LM-head, routed MoE, and shared
     expert verifier paths where applicable.
   - The generated-kernel pipeline must be turnkey: perf sweeps emit CSV for
     verifier aspect/work buckets and codebooks, the trainer emits checked-in
     C++ `.inc` dispatch tables, and backend code consumes those tables without
     ad hoc per-codebook overrides. Exact `(M,N,K)` winners may exist only as
     overlays above a broad generated fallback. The durable policy must be
     trained on aspect ratio plus work-size segments so a new model with nearby
     dimensions does not require a fresh training run before it can use the
     grouped verifier path.
   - The sweep/trainer must cover the full Q-quant, K-quant, and IQ-quant
     families used by Qwen3.5/Qwen3.6 dense and MoE weights, not only the
     codebooks present in one benchmark model.
   - M=2/3/4 trained kernels must be graph-capturable on CUDA and ROCm, use
     explicit non-null streams, consume declared workspace, and avoid raw
     cuda/hip allocations.  CPU kernels must follow the existing scalar/AVX2/
     AVX512 runtime-dispatch pattern where vectorized paths are introduced.
   - Promotion requires a focused perf win over the serial fallback for the same
     row count/backend/model/sampling lane and no full-model regression versus
     the current guarded path.

5. Strict numeric proof
   - Reuse the existing Qwen3.6 dense and MoE parity suites wherever possible.
     Extend the existing `VerifierRowsDecodeEquivalentM[1-4]` coverage or add
     adjacent `VerifierRowsGroupedDecodeEquivalentM[2-4]` tests for the grouped
     path.
   - Every verifier row must compare full logit distributions against the
     serial decode oracle using cosine similarity, relative L2, and symmetric
     KL/KLD. Top-token equality alone is not sufficient.
   - Greedy tests must verify accepted length, correction token, bonus token,
     final hidden row, KV/cache positions, and continuation tokens.
   - Stochastic tests must additionally verify RNG draw positions, accepted
     rows, residual/correction sampling, bonus sampling, and continuation under
     the same seed.
   - State publication tests must compare the grouped verifier's published
     state with a serial continuation, not just verifier-row logits.

6. Cleanup and reconciliation
   - Reconcile the Phase 10 documentation/status rows with the code capability
     flags so "grouped verifier green" cannot mean "serial fallback is correct".
   - Rename comments and metrics where needed to separate
     `serial_decode_equivalent_fallback` from
     `grouped_decode_equivalent_verifier`.
   - Delete or demote retired experimental all-position verifier paths only
     after the grouped path has passed correctness and perf gates on CPU, CUDA,
     and ROCm.
   - Keep dynamic-depth policy tables conservative until fixed d1/d2/d3 grouped
     evidence is speed-positive.

7. Multi-participant verifier economy
   - Add a TP-aware compact verifier outcome contract for sharded logits. The
     contract must cover LocalTP, NodeLocalTP/GlobalTP, and LocalPP final-stage
     domains, with rank/device participation decided by the same graph-native
     collective plan used by the main model.
   - Greedy sharded verification must compute a global row argmax for each
     verifier row before acceptance/correction. Stochastic sharded verification
     must compute globally normalized distributions or an equivalent distributed
     top-k/top-p/rejection sampler with the same RNG draw positions as the
     serial oracle.
   - Accepted-state publication remains common-prefix/domain-wide: every
     participant publishes or none do, using the same accepted count and
     correction token. A participant-local compact outcome is invalid unless it
     is accompanied by the domain-wide reduced metadata.
   - GlobalTP/NodeLocalTP implementations must use a narrow typed collective
     helper or existing TP collective abstraction, not ad hoc MPI/NCCL/RCCL
     calls inside MTP-specific runner code.
   - Dedicated LocalTP and GlobalTP integration tests must prove strict
     cosine, relative L2, symmetric KL/KLD, sampled-token, accepted-count, and
     published-continuation equivalence before any sharded verifier lane is
     promoted out of the serial fallback.

  --output-on-failure --parallel
```

The generated-kernel proof gate must compare each trained M=2/3/4 kernel
against serial M=1 GEMV/GEMM for every supported codebook and verifier shape.
For model-level promotion, dense and MoE grouped verifier rows must pass strict
full-distribution cosine, relative L2, and symmetric KL/KLD checks against the
serial decode oracle before the trained table is selected by production code.

Backend-specific evidence:

- CUDA: `LLAMINAR_PROFILING=1` for attribution only, clean-shell benchmark for
  throughput, and `nsys`/`ncu` only for targeted kernel diagnosis. Do not quote
  profiling-enabled decode throughput as the acceptance number because graph
  capture is intentionally disabled under executor profiling.
- ROCm: use `rocprof` per-dispatch timing for grouped verifier kernels and treat
  wallclock-only improvements as insufficient evidence on PCIe-bound systems.
- CPU: use release-build matrix rows and CPU sampler/LM-head focused timings to
  show the row-indexed path reduced verifier, sampler, and publication cost
  without weakening the serial decode oracle.

Exit criteria:

- CUDA and ROCm verifier transaction decisions are host-bridge free: zero
  hot-path H2D/D2H bytes and zero hot-path transfer-induced syncs in perfstats,
  excluding explicit final response materialization.
- LocalTP and GlobalTP/NodeLocalTP have explicit sharded compact verifier
  reducers for greedy and stochastic, or their Phase 9.8 dashboard rows remain
  unaccepted and fail-closed behind the labelled serial fallback.
- CPU uses the same compact verifier metadata contract as GPU and avoids full
  all-position LM-head work for promoted verifier rows.
- Dense grouped/batched verifier M=2/3/4 passes strict cosine, relative L2, and
  symmetric KL/KLD checks on CPU, CUDA, and ROCm for greedy and stochastic.
- MoE grouped routed+shared verifier M=2/3/4 passes the same strict metrics and
  `MainVerifierPublishedStateMatchesSerialContinuation` on CPU, CUDA, and ROCm.
- CPU, CUDA, and ROCm trained/generated M=2/3/4 verifier kernels cover all
  supported Q/K/IQ codebooks, pass serial M=1 numerical equivalence in focused
  integration tests, and are wired into production only after dense/MoE grouped
  verifier parity passes strict cosine, relative L2, and symmetric KL/KLD.
- Grouped paths are faster than serial fallback in focused verifier harnesses
  and do not regress same-run full-model MTP benchmark rows. Lanes that fail
  either condition remain on fail-closed serial fallback and are not eligible
  for Phase 10 default enablement.
- Dashboard rows include same-run baseline, verifier time, condition-token time,
  publication time, sampler/outcome time, graph replay time, grouped-path status,
  and host-bridge status for every backend/model/sampling lane.

Current status:

- [x] Phase added to close the gap between Phase 9.7 correctness proofs and
  Phase 10 speed/default-readiness evidence.
- [x] Verifier-economy capability contract added in
  `MTPDecodeCatchup`/`IInferenceRunner`, with `DeviceGraphOrchestrator` and
  `RankOrchestrator` reporting correct serial fallback separately from
  grouped/promoted verifier support. Focused unit coverage proves
  `RankOrchestrator` clamps to the weakest participant and current
  SingleDevice lanes are not accidentally marked economical.
- [x] Verifier-economy capability printed in perfstats/matrix rows. MTP decode
  emits tagged dense/MoE `verifier_economy_capability` counters, and
  `summarize_mtp_perfstats.py`/`run_mtp_iteration_benchmark_matrix.sh` expose
  compact `verifier_economy_dense` and `verifier_economy_moe` columns for
  dashboard refreshes.
- [x] GPU request-batched stochastic depth-1 sidecar tokens can now publish
  directly into device draft slots. `OrchestrationRunner` skips the legacy
  draft-token H2D staging for this lane, while the compatibility host shadow is
  kept only for response/metadata materialization. Focused gate:
  `V2_Unit_(PrefillDecodeTransition|DeviceGraphOrchestrator|MTPSpecRequestBatchScheduler|MTPSpecDecodeMetadata)`.
- [x] Request-batched device draft publication now covers depth greater than
  one. CUDA/ROCm batched argmax supports strided output stores, so sidecar row
  `request i` writes directly to request-major slot
  `first_draft_slot + i * draft_depth`; the old per-request host-to-device
  draft staging hook is no longer used for promoted GPU stochastic request
  batches. Focused `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition` depth-1/2/3 regressions
  pin the slot layout, and `V2_Integration_GPUSamplingKernels` proves strided
  device-output argmax on CUDA and ROCm.
- [x] NativeVNNI trainer/generated-table guardrails are green for CUDA and
  ROCm. Focused gate:
  `V2_Unit_NativeVNNIDispatchRefreshScript`,
  `V2_Unit_CUDAGemvDispatchGeneratorAliases`,
  `V2_Unit_CUDAGemvDispatchBaseMerge`,
  `V2_Unit_CUDAPrefillDispatchGeneratorAliases`,
  `V2_Unit_ROCmNativeVNNITrainerGenerator`,
  `V2_Unit_ROCmNativeVNNIDecodeTrainerGenerator`,
  `V2_Unit_ROCmNativeVNNIBatchedDecodeTrainerGenerator`,
  `V2_Unit_ROCmNativeVNNITrainerCsvValidator`, and
  `V2_Unit_NativeVNNIGeneratedDispatchCodebooks`.
- [x] Focused M=2/3/4 kernel serial-equivalence proofs are green for the
  current CPU/CUDA/ROCm NativeVNNI paths. CPU passed
  `MTP_SmallM_{FusedProjection_AllFormats,AllFormatsMatchSerialDecodeRows,Qwen36ShapesMatchSerialDecodeRows}`.
  CUDA passed `MTP_SmallM_FusedProjection_AllNativeFormats` and
  `NativeVNNISpecializedSmallM234_AllNativeFormatsMatchSerialGEMVs`; the CUDA
  assertion now keeps the strict relative-L2/cosine gates and treats sub-3e-4
  absolute KPAR reduction-order spikes as outlier diagnostics. ROCm passed
  `SpecializedSmallM234_AllNativeFormatsMatchSerialGEMVs`,
  `DispatchNativeSmallMAllCodebooksMatchReference`, and graph-captured Qwen3.6
  GDN projection samples for M=2/M=4.
- [x] Focused trainer/perf CSV smoke is green for the generated-dispatch
  pipeline. CPU `MTP_SmallM_TrainerCsv_AllFormats` now emits machine-readable
  default-route rows for M=2/3/4; the focused Q4_0/IQ4_XS smoke produced six
  rows at about 156-177 us. CUDA `GemvSweepPerf.Sweep_GemvDispatchCsv`
  emitted 48 Qwen3.6 GDN time-projection rows for Q4_0 and IQ4_XS at M=2/3/4,
  selecting KPAR winners per codebook and row count. ROCm
  `TrainerCsv_BatchedProjectionCodebookTagged` emitted 18 Qwen3.6 fused
  batched verifier projection rows across Q4_K/Q5_K/Q4_1/Q5_1 and M=2/3/4,
  all projection-correct. The ROCm batched-projection trainer now records and
  gates `cosine`, `relative_l2`, and `max_abs` metrics, and the generated
  summary preserves those values for auditability. A direct runtime promotion
  of the older projection-only table was rejected: strict Qwen3.6 ROCm verifier
  parity failed at M=2/M=3 even though M=4 passed. The next ROCm table must
  train or filter on serial-decode-equivalent verifier logits/state, not
  projection-only output. This is pipeline smoke only; CPU generated-table
  consumption and the full all-codebook generated-table acceptance boxes remain
  open.
- [x] CPU generated-table consumption is wired for verifier rows. Production
  CPU NativeVNNI dispatch now consults
  `CPUNativeVNNIVerifierRowsPolicyGenerated.inc` for trained M=2/3/4 verifier
  policy before falling back to the generic row policy. The CPU analyzer now
  rejects rows that pass cosine/relative-L2/symmetric-KL gates but are not
  faster than serial decode, and the refresh unit fixture proves those
  correct-but-uneconomical rows are excluded from generated policy. A
  family-smoke refresh across the full CPU codebook inventory for the
  Qwen3.6 GDN time-projection shape generated 47 speed-positive rows; the
  excluded rows stay unpromoted until a future sweep proves them economical.
  The CPU verifier trainer now carries `LLAMINAR_CPU_NVNNI_VERIFIER_SHAPE_NAME`
  through CSV output, and the refresh wrapper supplies each Qwen3.6 projection
  shape name so generated policy comments no longer collapse every row to a
  generic verifier label.
  `V2_Perf_CPUNativeVNNI_VerifierRows` is now the focused registered CTest for
  this microbench; the older `V2_Perf_CPUNativeVNNI_GEMV` remains the broad
  sweep target.
  Focused registered microbench evidence:
  `V2_Perf_CPUNativeVNNI_VerifierRows` passed with strict cosine 1.0,
  relative L2 0, symmetric KL 0 and N=K=5120 speedups Q4_K M2/M3/M4
  `1.40/1.49/1.63x`, Q6_K `1.75/1.83/2.03x`, and IQ4_XS
  `1.55/1.50/1.97x`. A long-K Q4_K FFN-down probe at N=5120,K=17408
  passed at `1.88/2.39/2.74x`. Full Qwen3.6 multi-shape all-codebook
  generation remains open.
- [x] CPU component verifier gates are green, and the dense verifier path has
  moved from weak to meaningfully economical but still below the aspirational
  M4 target. `V2_Perf_CPUGatedDeltaNetVerifierRows`,
  `V2_Perf_CPUFlashAttentionVerifierRows`, and
  `V2_Perf_DenseVerifierRows_CPU` pass after the NativeVNNI policy wiring,
  direct merged-QKV CPU GDN verifier path, and grow-only overwrite verifier
  state slots. The latest registered full-pipeline M2/M3/M4 speedups are
  `1.5639/1.7712/2.1822x` with exact cosine/relative-L2/symmetric-KL; a
  detailed M4-only pass measured `2.4964x` after reducing grouped M4 GDN
  recurrence from about `151ms` to about `53ms`. The next CPU Phase 9.8 slice
  should focus on remaining GEMM, gate/up, GDN projection, and LM-head costs.
  The CPU GDN verifier-row microbench now uses balanced paired timing instead
  of measuring all grouped samples before all serial samples; the previous M2
  failure was cache/order bias in the perf harness, not numerical drift. Current
  GDN-only M2/M3/M4 speedups are `1.2443/1.3732/1.4087x`, so it remains correct
  but only modestly economical.
- [x] GPU MoE verifier-prefill speedometers now hard-gate economy as well as
  strict metrics for the paths that remain supported. The rejected single-table
  routed+shared shortcut, its grouping kernels, workspace buffers, perf tests,
  and integration tests have been removed rather than kept as negative debt.
  The accepted production path is split branch-local verifier math: routed
  experts use the proven grouped verifier pipeline; the shared expert uses
  decode-equivalent M=2/3/4 GEMV-many gate/up and SwiGLU/down projections; the
  normal shared-gate add combines the two outputs. Sprint gate:
  `LLAMINAR_MOE_VERIFIER_PREFILL_ITERS=5 LLAMINAR_MOE_VERIFIER_PREFILL_WARMUPS=1 LLAMINAR_MOE_VERIFIER_PREFILL_ROWWISE_ITERS=1 build_v2_release/tests/v2/v2_perf_moe_verifier_prefill --gtest_filter='Perf__MoEVerifierPrefill.CUDA_M1234_RoutedAndShared:Perf__MoEVerifierPrefill.CUDA_M4_CombinedRoutedSharedUpperBound:Perf__MoEVerifierPrefill.CUDA_M234_SharedExpertFFNStageDecodeEquivalent:Perf__MoEVerifierPrefill.ROCm_M1234_RoutedAndShared:Perf__MoEVerifierPrefill.ROCm_M4_CombinedRoutedSharedUpperBound:Perf__MoEVerifierPrefill.ROCm_M234_SharedExpertFFNStageDecodeEquivalent'`.
  Latest strict routed/shared component rows before the shortcut deletion had
  cosine `1.0`, relative L2 below `3e-7`, and symmetric KL `0`; CUDA routed
  M2/M3/M4 speedups were `63.1/78.5/94.2x`, shared `48.7/68.1/102.7x`; ROCm
  routed `22.4/21.8/26.2x`, shared `16.6/20.0/24.2x`. Focused gate passed:
  `LLAMINAR_MOE_VERIFIER_PREFILL_ITERS=20 LLAMINAR_MOE_VERIFIER_PREFILL_WARMUPS=3 ctest --test-dir build_v2_release -V -R '^V2_Perf_GPUSpeculativeSummary$|^V2_Perf_MoEVerifierPrefill$|^V2_Perf_DenseVerifierRows_CUDA$|^V2_Perf_DenseVerifierRows_ROCm$|^V2_Perf_DenseVerifierRows_CPU$|^V2_Perf_CPUNativeVNNI_VerifierRows$|^V2_Perf_CPUGatedDeltaNetVerifierRows$' --output-on-failure --parallel`.
- [x] CUDA and ROCm generated-dispatch refresh now covers the real Qwen3.6 MoE
  expert verifier buckets. The `qwen36-moe` profile trains
  `35BMoE_Expert_GateUp` and `35BMoE_Expert_Down` across M=1..4 and all
  backend-supported Q/K/IQ codebooks without hand-coded overrides. CUDA
  qwen36-moe refresh passed with 102,904 source rows, 128 runtime dispatch
  rows, and 100% family/exact/known-shape coverage. ROCm qwen36-moe refresh
  passed with 120 generated decode entries and validated codebook references.
  A non-install merged pass combining the previous dense/GDN/LM-head staged
  CSVs with the fresh MoE CSVs also validated: CUDA produced 576 runtime rows
  with 100% family/exact/known-shape coverage, and ROCm produced 540 generated
  decode entries across the full qwen36 dense/GDN/LM-head/MoE shape set.
  These artifacts were intentionally not installed as standalone replacements;
  CUDA/ROCm table acceptance still requires a merged dense/GDN/LM-head/MoE
  refresh from fresh sweeps plus full model-level parity and MTP decode
  benchmark gates.
- [x] Greedy GPU all-position verification no longer re-uploads first-token or
  draft-token shadows when the runner advertises device slots. Main-logits
  greedy sampling writes the first target token into the runner-owned target
  arena, fused sidecar sampling writes each draft into the draft arena, the
  verifier and greedy reducer consume that prepared row, and opted-in failures
  hard-fail instead of silently falling back to host sampling/upload. Focused gate:
  `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition` and
  `V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy`; real-model graph smoke:
  `V2_Integration_PrefixCacheMTP_Qwen36CUDAGpuGraphsSmoke` and
  `V2_Integration_PrefixCacheMTP_Qwen36ROCmGpuGraphsSmoke`.
- [x] Greedy GPU all-position compact outcomes now use the same
  `DeviceSpeculativeOutcomeHandle` contract as stochastic verification.
  `OrchestrationRunner` publishes accepted state from resident compact metadata
  before materializing the compatibility host response plan, and the static
  guard prevents the hot path from calling the legacy host-returning verifier.
  Focused gate: `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition`,
  `V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy`, and the CUDA/ROCm Qwen3.6 graph
  smokes listed above.
- [x] Resident greedy GPU verifier outcomes no longer have a host token-row H2D
  compatibility path. A missing materialized device verifier row now hard-fails
  as a coherence error, and `V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy` guards
  against reintroducing `hostToDeviceOnStream()` in the resident verifier body.
  CUDA/ROCm Qwen3.6 graph smokes pass after the removal.
- [x] Resident publication base cached-token counts now come from a
  pre-verifier device snapshot, not a post-verifier host upload. DGO copies the
  KV cache's device sequence-count mirror into the MTP metadata workspace before
  verifier replay mutates live KV state, keeps the snapshot through scoped-plan
  teardown, rejects missing snapshots, and the runner no longer attaches a host
  base-cache shadow to resident publication requests.
  Focused gate: `V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy`,
  `V2_Unit_MTPSpecDecodeMetadata`, `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition`, and the
  CUDA/ROCm Qwen3.6 graph smokes.
- [x] The all-position runner path now calls an explicit host-response
  materialization boundary after device-resident publication, instead of naming
  the compatibility D2H as host-plan materialization. `IInferenceRunner` keeps
  the old host-plan adapter only as a legacy delegate, while structural guards
  require publication and sidecar prelaunch to occur before response
  materialization and still forbid the low-level host copy hook in the runner
  branch. Focused gate: `V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy`,
  `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition`, and the CUDA/ROCm Qwen3.6 graph smokes.
- [x] Dense grouped/batched verifier M=2/3/4 strict correctness is green on
  CPU, CUDA, and ROCm. The latest CPU M=2 regression (`row0 cos=0.9970
  rel_l2=0.0780`, `row1 cos=0.9984 rel_l2=0.0572`) was fixed by making CPU
  short-conv grouped verifier rows call the same serial decode channel/update
  and output-store helpers as one-token decode. Focused gates:
  `V2_Integration_Parity_Qwen36_CPU_SingleDevice_Qwen36CPUSingleDevicePrefixMTPParity_VerifierRowsGroupedDecodeEquivalentM[2-4]`,
  `V2_Integration_Parity_Qwen36_ROCm_SingleDevice_Qwen36ROCmSingleDevicePrefixMTPParity_VerifierRowsGroupedDecodeEquivalentM[1-4]`,
  `V2_Integration_Parity_Qwen36_CUDA_SingleDevice_Qwen36CUDASingleDevicePrefixMTPParity_VerifierRowsGroupedDecodeEquivalentM[1-4]`,
  and `V2_Integration_ROCmFlashAttentionParity` raw/stage/captured M=2/3/4
  Qwen3.6 attention rows. A later CUDA M4 full-graph regression proved that
  isolated quantized GEMV equivalence was not enough: cuBLAS selected different
  schedules for serial M=1 versus grouped M=4 FP32 GDN alpha/beta projections.
  CUDA now uses a graph-capturable tiny FP32 fixed-reduction projection kernel
  for M<=4,N<=64, matching the existing ROCm pattern. Focused reruns passed
  `Test__CUDAGemmParity.GDNProjectionStage_Qwen36MixedCodebooks_M4MatchesFourM1StageRows`
  and
  `Qwen36CUDASingleDevicePrefixMTPParity.VerifierRowsGroupedDecodeEquivalentM[1-4]`.
- [x] Pathological large-model GPU load stall is fixed for production and
  Qwen3.6 parity/perf helpers. `MmapRegion` now exposes an explicit
  eager-prefault policy bit, CPU/NUMA loads keep the historical eager path, and
  GPU-target loads use lazy demand-paged mmap with sequential advice instead of
  whole-file `MAP_POPULATE` or `MADV_WILLNEED`. Qwen3.6 dense/MoE helpers now
  create configured GPU-target `ModelContext` objects instead of the legacy
  factory path. Focused guard: `V2_Unit_MmapRegion`. Observed CUDA dense
  verifier perf now starts weight upload immediately and loads 14.3GB in 4.5s;
  the same perf test fails only on verifier economy, not loader hang.
- [x] The intermittent CPU model-load crawl has a production guard. Single-rank
  CPU mmap loads and node-leader multi-rank CPU loads now explicitly
  prepopulate the page cache and skip immediate mmap cache eviction, with
  structured perfstats counters/timers. The same sprint fixed the exposed CPU
  MoE MTP lifecycle bug: nextn/MTP-only MoE expert slabs are prepared into
  `PreparedWeightStore` before host raw data release, so first sidecar graph
  construction never repacks from released raw tensors. Focused gates:
  `V2_Unit_NodeLeaderPageCache`,
  `MTPMoESidecarReusesPreparedExpertSlabsAfterRawRelease`, and focused CPU
  Qwen3.6 MoE MTP d2 E2E `20260620_081525` (`27/27`).
- [x] CUDA and ROCm dense M=2/3/4 grouped verifier economy is accepted for
  the current GPU proof lane. The rejected CUDA M=2 row was fixed by removing
  hidden small-M serial GDN/short-conv verifier helpers on both GPU backends
  and adding grouped small-M short-conv kernels that compute all verifier rows
  and final live state in one graph-capturable launch. Focused gates:
	  `V2_Unit_GDNKernels`, `V2_Unit_GDNMathematicalCorrectness`,
	  `Qwen36(CUDA|ROCm)SingleDevicePrefixMTPParity.VerifierRowsGroupedDecodeEquivalentM[2-4]`,
		  and `V2_Perf_DenseVerifierRows_(CUDA|ROCm)`. Latest release rows with two
		  timed iterations: CUDA M2/3/4 total grouped-vs-serial speedups
		  `1.50x/1.97x/2.40x` and forward-only speedups
		  `1.74x/2.31x/2.90x`; ROCm total `1.29x/1.56x/1.73x`
		  and forward-only `1.46x/1.84x/2.02x`. All rows reported
		  cosine `1.0`, relative L2 `0`, and symmetric KL `0`. CUDA GDN alpha/beta
	  tiny FP32 projections are now included in this contract rather than hidden
	  behind cuBLAS batched GEMM.
	  2026-06-18 ROCm follow-up fixed the Qwen3.6 fused QKV/GDN projection drift by
	  grouping fused small-M batches by the serial M=1 native-VNNI split-K policy
	  before launch. `V2_Integration_ROCmQuantisedGemmSmallM` passes 42/42,
	  including all-codebook small-M, mixed-codebook GDN, graph-captured
	  SwiGLU/down, strict cosine/relative-L2/symmetric-KL rows, and unsafe split-K
	  hard-fail coverage. Real-model ROCm dense grouped verifier parity
		  `VerifierRowsGroupedDecodeEquivalentM[2-4]` passes. Correctness is
		  accepted; ROCm dense verifier economics remain below the hardware-ceiling
		  target and need the next NativeVNNI/GDN/attention tuning pass. The dense
		  verifier perf harness now prints replay-scoped restore/setup/forward/sample
		  timing on every row, so future sweeps can identify whether a backend is
		  losing in grouped-forward work or in shared restore overhead.
- [x] CPU compact row-indexed verifier and LM-head path is wired and proven for
  dense M=2/3/4 strict correctness. The graph selects compact hidden rows into
  `lm_head_input_rows`, projects compact logits through the decode-equivalent
  LM-head row contract, and the focused CPU grouped parity gate compares every
  row against serial decode with cosine, relative L2, symmetric KL, and sampled
  token checks.
- [x] CPU dense M=2/3/4 verifier economy is accepted for the current
  SingleDevice dense proof lane. NativeVNNI now
  quantizes verifier activations once and, for long-K verifier shapes, computes
  row-shared M=2..4 K-tile partials before reducing them in the exact same
  tile order as serial M=1 decode. This replaced the safe but slow streamed
  row path and avoids promoting the non-equivalent wide-row kernels that failed
  the Q5_K strict regression at about `1e-3` max error. The promoted primitive
  uses the same single-row tile kernels and strict K-tile reduction contract
  for scalar/AVX2 fallback, while AVX512 shares each packed-B tile across
  verifier rows only when the partial is reduced later. The fused
  multi-projection descriptor path now supports long-K descriptors with the
  same partial-sum contract instead of rejecting them and falling back to
  per-projection scheduling. The latest registered
  `V2_Perf_DenseVerifierRows_CPU` CTest gate passes after generated-policy
  wiring and the GDN verifier-state cleanup; the latest visible replay-scoped
  run measured `2.9931x/3.0453x/4.4277x` for M2/M3/M4 with cosine `1.0`,
  relative L2 `0`, and symmetric KL `0`. K-tiled verifier
  scratch and CPU GDN verifier state slots now use uninitialized overwrite-only
  storage instead of paying redundant zero-fill. The focused
  Q4_K/Q6_K long-K sweep stayed exact, but the latency did not materially move.
  The perf harness can now force `WideRows` or `Pairwise` through the same
  production k-tiled verifier entrypoint, so the trainer can learn real
  long-K policy choices instead of relying on the removed non-tiled M4 candidate
  probe. The CPU qwen36 refresh profiles now pass required `(format,M,N,K)`
  keys to the analyzer and fail closed if a production shape does not generate
  a speed-positive strict-equivalent row. Required-key validation now skips
  decode M=1 so the generated verifier policy covers only M=2..4 rows, and
  required-key CPU profiles default to warmup `5` and iterations `10` so
  production table generation is stable by default. A qwen36-core CPU sweep
  plus targeted stable retries generated strict rows across all Q/K/IQ
  codebooks for dense/GDN verifier shapes, a qwen36-lm-head sweep added
  51 strict rows for the real vocabulary-sized LM-head shape, and the new
  qwen36-moe profile added the real MoE expert gate/up and down verifier
  buckets. The installed combined table now has 459 rows across dense, GDN,
  LM-head, and MoE expert verifier shapes. The qwen36-moe refresh first failed
  closed on speed-negative M=2 expert-down rows; the fix was to run the same
  grouped 2-row chunk kernel directly for small MoE work when OpenMP fork/join
  overhead would dominate. The analyzer rejected outlier rows instead of
  quietly falling back; targeted reruns proved those keys exact and economical,
  for example IQ3_XXS/IQ2_XS FFN-gate M2 around `2.01x`, Q8_1/Q3_K GDN-inner
  M2 around `1.99x`, Q8_1 GDN-output M3 around `64.28x`, and MoE expert
  gate/up Q4_K/Q6_K M2..4 at `1.49x/2.00x/2.40x` and
  `1.46x/2.53x/3.48x`. The latest Q4_K FFN-down probe measured default
  `1.81x/1.99x/2.01x` for M2/M3/M4; forced wide M4 was `2.00x`, while forced
  pairwise M4 was `0.34x`, proving pairwise is not a viable long-K fallback for
  that shape. LM-head production rows are exact and substantially more
  economical, with all-codebook production averages around `1.99x/2.48x/3.29x`
  for M2/M3/M4 and Q4_K at `2.00x/2.76x/3.66x`.
  Explicit K-tile sweeps showed no easy
  policy-only win, so the next CPU lift likely needs a new partial layout,
  fused reduction, or AMX-style row group rather than more `k_tiles` tuning. The stripped
  VPDPBUSD instruction-floor diagnostic reports only about `1.05x` at M=4 with
  the current packed-B layout, which makes the aspirational `3.5x` CPU M4
  target a layout/ISA project rather than a local scheduling tweak.
  `V2_Perf_CPUNativeVNNI_GEMV.MTP_VerifierRows_GroupedVsSerial_Synthetic`
  exports CSV with structural packed-layout features (`is_nibble_lut`,
  `payload_bytes`, `is_asymmetric`, `is_superblock`) and strict cosine,
  relative L2, and symmetric KL checks. Long-K all-codebook sweep
  (`N=5120,K=17408,M=2/3/4`) is exact with cosine `1.0`, relative L2 `0`,
  symmetric KL `0`; the latest broad sweep measures `1.66x-2.39x`
  grouped-vs-serial, with M2/M3/M4 averages `1.86x/1.91x/2.26x`.
  Representative rows: Q4_K `1.81x/2.12x/2.22x`, Q6_K
  `1.89x/1.95x/2.26x`; rerun outliers for IQ2_XS/IQ1_M M2 measured
  near `1.9x`, confirming the earlier 12ms rows were timing noise.
  The CPU refresh/training wrapper now has first-class `--backend cpu` support;
  qwen36 CPU profiles default to forced policy A/B training, required-key
  validation proves requested production rows exist before install, and
  generated include validation accepted canonical codebook references. Unknown
  verifier-policy keys now select the pairwise economy floor, not the wide-row
  candidate, and `MTP_VerifierRowsUntrainedShapeUsesPairwiseFloor` locks the
  untrained Q4_K 5120x5120 M=3 regression. Focused gates passed:
  `V2_Integration_CPUNativeVNNI_GEMV` direct MTP subset with real
  Qwen3.6 GDN output weights, registered CTest
  `V2_Integration_CPUNativeVNNI_GEMV`,
  `V2_Unit_NativeVNNIDispatchRefreshScript`,
  `V2_Unit_NativeVNNIGeneratedDispatchCodebooks`, release
  `V2_Perf_CPUNativeVNNI_VerifierRows`, `V2_Perf_DenseVerifierRows_CPU`, the
  qwen36-lm-head and qwen36-moe CPU refresh/profile gates, the representative
  MoE expert gate/up and down verifier perf gate with
  `LLAMINAR_CPU_NVNNI_VERIFIER_MIN_SPEEDUP=1.0`, and the broader release
  `V2_Perf_CPUNativeVNNI_GEMV` (`391s` wall). The aspirational CPU M4
  target is now met in the dense proof lane; broader CPU MoE economics still
  need full-pipeline reduction of `gate_up_proj`, `down_proj`, GDN
  recurrence/projection, LM head, and embedding overhead.
  `stage_cpu_detail` perfstats expose node-level CPU stage cost so the next
  CPU sprint can attribute those remaining regressions.
- [x] CPU GDN verifier-row microbench uses signed synthetic inputs and strict
  output/state cosine, relative L2, symmetric KL, and max-absolute checks.
  The exact-order grouped path passes the registered
  `V2_Perf_CPUGatedDeltaNetVerifierRows` gate with M2/M3/M4 speedups around
  `1.04x/1.34x/1.38x`. The production GDN recurrence stage now uses a direct
  merged-QKV verifier kernel for CPU verifier chunks, avoiding host-side
  deinterleave and sharing the exact serial decode recurrence helpers. Its
  overwrite-only verifier state slots also avoid hot-path zero-fill, which cut
  grouped M4 dense verifier GDN recurrence from about `151ms` to about `53ms`.
  A closed-form all-row recurrence experiment was rejected and removed: it
  changed floating-point order enough to miss the strict output relative-L2
  gate and was slower for M=2. GDN is no longer the primary CPU dense blocker;
  remaining work is projection/GEMM/LM-head economics plus the broader M4
  layout/ISA target.
- [x] CPU flash-attention verifier-row microbench is registered and green for
  the production decode-equivalent verifier API. `compute_flash_fp32()` now
  splits decode-equivalent verifier work over `(head,row)` tasks instead of
  head-only tasks, preserving each row's serial floating-point order while
  preventing long-context M=2 verifier batches from underutilizing CPU workers.
  `V2_Perf_CPUFlashAttentionVerifierRows` compares grouped production rows
  against M independent one-token decode calls with cosine, relative L2,
  max-absolute, per-row metrics, and symmetric KL checks. Latest release rows:
  context 2048 M2/M3/M4 = `2.44x/2.23x/3.51x`; context 8192 M2/M3/M4 =
  `1.78x/1.60x/2.33x`, all with cosine `1.0`, relative L2 `0`, and symmetric
  KL `0`. Focused gates:
  `V2_Perf_CPUFlashAttentionVerifierRows` and
  `V2_Unit_CPUFlashAttentionKernelT`.
- [x] Scalar device-indexed GDN and short-conv publication is device-owned on
  CUDA and ROCm. `GDNRecurrenceStage` and `ShortConv1dStage` no longer pass
  host mirror pointers into the device-index restore path, and the CUDA/ROCm
  tensor wrappers no longer perform D2H refresh or stream synchronization from
  `restoreVerifierStateCaptureRowFromDeviceIndex()`. Focused gate:
  `V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy`, `V2_Unit_GDNKernels`, and
  `V2_Unit_MTPSpecStateContract`; real-runner smoke:
  `V2_Integration_PrefixCacheMTP_Qwen36(CUDA|ROCm)GpuGraphsStochasticSmoke`.
- [x] Dense request-batched resident publication is not blocked by the hybrid
  recurrent-state guard. The DGO guard now fails request batches only when the
  model has GDN/short-conv verifier state that still lacks per-request live
  storage.
- [x] Hybrid/GDN request-batched all-position verifier graphs carry request
  shape through graph construction instead of hiding the missing ownership
  model. Unsupported backends now fail at the stage/kernel capability boundary,
  where the explicit live-state-bank contract can name the missing backend
  feature. Focused gate: `V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy` and
  `V2_Unit_MTPGraphConstruction`.
- [x] Request-batched verifier-state restore has a shared stage and
  tensor-kernel contract with default hard-fail semantics. GDN recurrence and
  short-conv stages now expose the batch hook and delegate to the backend
  batch API instead of looping scalar restore. Focused gate:
  `V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy`.
- [x] `MTPSpecStatePublisher` has a request-batched device-index publication
  helper that validates GPU + explicit-stream ownership and calls captured
  stages through the batch restore hook exactly once. Focused gate:
  `V2_Unit_MTPSpecStateContract`.
- [x] Qwen3.5/Qwen3.6 GDN graph construction now passes request shape
  (`request_count`, `request_seq_len`) into short-conv and GDN recurrence
  stages instead of leaving them with only flattened token count. Focused gate:
  `V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy`.
- [x] CUDA and ROCm short-conv/GDN wrappers now provide request-owned
  recurrent live-state banks for verifier batches. Batched verifier execution
  restores each request from its own device row-index, captures
  `[request,row,state]` snapshots in the existing flat transaction layout, and
  rejects invalid flattened shapes or scalar effective-length shortcuts instead
  of carrying state across requests. Focused gate:
  `V2_Unit_MTPSpecStateContract`, `V2_Unit_MTPGraphConstruction`,
  `V2_Unit_GDNKernels`, and `V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy`.
- [ ] CUDA/ROCm MoE direct device-resident publication is promoted. The
  grouped MoE verifier path is now decode-equivalent for M=1..4 on both CUDA
  and ROCm, but direct publication and full-pipeline economics still need a
  fresh same-run benchmark before the capability can graduate. A CUDA
  routing/shared metadata race that caused illegal memory access was fixed by
  separating routing-generated expert-id workspace from shared-expert table
  metadata. A later ROCm drift was fixed by preserving immutable full routing
  tensors while one-token scoped replay temporarily points `params_` at row
  scratch. Device-resident publication remains open until the grouped verifier
  path, stochastic lane, and benchmark economics are accepted together.
- [x] Focused CUDA/ROCm attention and GDN/short-conv surfaces have strict
  evidence. CUDA attention stage/captured append+attention M=2 and ROCm
  attention stage/captured append+attention M=2/3/4 match serial decode;
  CUDA/ROCm GDN recurrence and short-conv verifier rows pass strict max-abs,
  relative-L2, cosine, and symmetric-KL checks. MoE grouped expert FFN remains
  the active red model-level surface.
- [x] GPU MoE verifier economy reporting now distinguishes unavailable,
  grouped-outcome, and promoted resident-publication lanes. CUDA/ROCm MoE
  runners now enter grouped stochastic verification and publish accepted state
  from resident device metadata; CPU MoE remains on the host/shared contract.
  Focused gates: `V2_Unit_MTPVerifierPolicy`,
  `V2_Unit_DeviceGraphOrchestrator`, `V2_Unit_RankOrchestrator`, plus the
  CUDA/ROCm real-model resident-publication guards.
- [x] `MTPVerifierPolicy` exposes both the middle state and the promoted state.
  `GroupedDecodeEquivalentOutcome` now means grouped verifier math plus a
  required device-resident publication handoff in the runner. Direct
  all-position publication still wins only when the runner advertises the
  stronger all-position state-publication capability. PerfStats emits
  `verifier_policy_selections` and
  `grouped_outcome_device_resident_publication_uses` so benchmark captures can
  separate "grouped proof exists" from "economical transaction is actually
  fast". Focused gate:
  `V2_Unit_(MTPVerifierPolicy|DeviceGraphOrchestrator|RankOrchestrator)`.
- [x] Grouped greedy and stochastic outcome plans now carry an explicit replay-publication
  contract. `MTPSpecTransactionBatchPlan` distinguishes direct accepted-state
  publication from `DecodeEquivalentReplayPublicationRequired`; the owned
  greedy/stochastic publication executors refuse replay-required plans before invoking
  a direct publisher, so grouped-outcome evidence cannot quietly mutate live
  state. `OrchestrationRunner` direct-publication callsites also reject the
  contract before backend publication. Focused gate passed:
  `V2_Unit_(MTPSpecStateContract|MTPVerifierForwardExecutor)` plus the CUDA/ROCm
  Qwen3.6 MoE replay guards
  `Qwen36MoE(CUDA|ROCm)SingleDevicePrefixMTPParity.MainVerifierUsesDecodeEquivalentReplayWhenPublicationUnsupported`.
- [x] CUDA/ROCm MoE d1 Prefix+MTP parity is green on the shared
  decode-equivalent publication contract. A CUDA regression had allowed
  host-visible positions to advance past shifted sidecar KV because direct
  resident publication was advertised without a device-side shifted-row
  synthesis/reuse proof. The direct publication path remains disabled until
  grouped all-position MoE rows pass strict continuation again. Focused gates:
  `V2_Unit_DeviceGraphOrchestrator`, `V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy`,
  `Qwen36MoE(CUDA|ROCm)SingleDevicePrefixMTPParity.MTPBenchmarkStyleDepth1EightTokensMatchesReference`.
- [x] The earlier CUDA/ROCm full-prefill MoE shortcut remains rejected. Its
  strict probes showed activation drift even though isolated routed/shared
  expert kernels were strict, so it is not the accepted architecture. The
  target production contract is resident publication from compact metadata and
  accepted verifier state rows; the current production-safe contract is
  sequential decode-equivalent replay.
- [ ] CUDA hot-path H2D/D2H verifier transaction dependencies removed.
- [ ] ROCm hot-path H2D/D2H verifier transaction dependencies removed.
- [x] Request-batched stochastic resident publication supports CUDA/ROCm
  recurrent and short-conv batch restore from device row-index arrays, then
  publishes KV, terminal hidden, and the logical-state mailbox from one
  resident handle before compact host outcomes are materialized.
  `OrchestrationRunner` now drives GPU stochastic request-batch publication
  through `DeviceSpeculativePublicationRequest`, adopts host mirrors from the
  resident logical-state mailbox metadata, and never invokes the host-plan
  state publisher on the resident path. Full
  compact host outcome materialization happens only after resident publication
  and host mirror adoption so it can feed response tokens and sampler
  bookkeeping. A source-level guard now enforces producer-handle -> resident
  publication -> host-mirror adoption -> response-bridge ordering. Focused
  gate:
  `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition`,
  `V2_Unit_MTPVerifierForwardExecutor`, `V2_Unit_MTPSpecStateContract`,
  `V2_Unit_MTPGraphConstruction`, `V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy`, and
  `V2_Integration_PrefixCacheMTP_Qwen36(CUDA|ROCm)GpuGraphsStochasticSmoke`.
- [x] Full compact stochastic outcome host bridge removed from request-batch
  planning/adoption decisions. The shared transaction planner now reconstructs
  host-side transaction plans from compact device rejection metadata plus the
  scheduled draft tokens, so the full output-token bridge is a response-output
  flush only. Focused gate:
  `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition`,
  `V2_Unit_MTPVerifierForwardExecutor`, `V2_Unit_MTPSpecStateContract`,
  `V2_Unit_MTPGraphConstruction`, `V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy`, and
  `V2_Integration_PrefixCacheMTP_Qwen36(CUDA|ROCm)GpuGraphsStochasticSmoke`.
- [x] Compact stochastic planning metadata bridge removed from
  request-batch planning/adoption decisions. `DeviceResidentHostStateAdoptionRequest`
  carries the resident logical-state mailbox plus scheduled base-cache counts;
  DGO validates the mailbox, copies only target sequence lengths, accepted
  counts, and publication flags through a named tiny adoption bridge, and
  refreshes host KV/position mirrors from that device metadata. The remaining
  full compact outcome bridge is response/sampler-only. Focused gate:
  `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition`,
  `V2_Unit_MTPVerifierForwardExecutor`, `V2_Unit_MTPSpecStateContract`,
  `V2_Unit_MTPGraphConstruction`, `V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy`, and
  `V2_Integration_PrefixCacheMTP_Qwen36(CUDA|ROCm)GpuGraphsStochasticSmoke`.
- [ ] LocalTP and GlobalTP grouped verifier support added for sharded logits:
  compact outcome reducers perform domain-wide argmax/top-k/top-p/probability
  acceptance across shards, and TP lanes fail-closed until that reducer is
  present for dense and MoE.
- [x] Dense grouped/batched verifier M=2/3/4 strict metrics and economy are
  fully accepted on CPU, CUDA, and ROCm for the current SingleDevice dense proof
  lane. CPU now passes the pinned CTest dense verifier gate with visible
  replay-scoped M2/M3/M4 rows `2.9931x/3.0453x/4.4277x`; CUDA/ROCm remain
  accepted for the current GPU proof lane.
- [ ] MoE grouped routed+shared verifier M=2/3/4 strict metrics green on CPU,
  CUDA, and ROCm. CUDA and ROCm full-model grouped verifier-row proof is now
  green for M=1..4. The divergence root cause was the shared expert using the
  prefill-style MoE grouped pipeline in the main verifier; diagnostics showed
  first drift at `MOE_SHARED_EXPERT_OUTPUT`. `SharedExpertFFNStage` now uses the
  decode-equivalent M=2..4 GEMV-many contract for shared gate/up and
  SwiGLU/down, with explicit stream and workspace ownership, while routed
  experts keep the grouped verifier path. The attempted combined routed+shared
  owner is not a supported production implementation: graph wiring and strict
  integration guards reject the
  `mtp.moe_combined_decode_equivalent_verifier_prefill_rows` counter so future
  work cannot accidentally promote the broken full-model path. Focused gates to
  keep green are `V2_Integration_ROCmMoEKernel`,
  the matching CUDA MoE kernel integration target when CUDA hardware is present,
  `V2_Integration_ROCmQuantisedGemmSmallM`, and `V2_Perf_MoEVerifierPrefill`.
  CUDA/ROCm grouped routed/shared kernel economics remain useful, but full-pipeline
  MoE stochastic is not speed-accepted yet. The remaining checkbox stays open
  until CPU has matching grouped routed/shared proof where applicable, direct
  publication has fresh strict continuation proof on every promoted backend,
  and full-pipeline MoE MTP economics are speed-positive. CPU decode-equivalent
  MoE stage replay is now stricter than before: shared expert, IQ3_S routed
  expert, top-k=8, and Qwen-sized Q4_K/Q5_K routed expert units cover M=2/3/4
  with cosine, relative L2, symmetric KL, and max-absolute checks against
  serial decode rows. A 2026-06-19 focused CUDA/ROCm proof reran MoE
  stochastic reuse plus grouped verifier M2/M3/M4 parity after the safe
  composite cleanup and passed on both backends. It also fixed a request-boundary
  reset regression where `clear_cache()` preserved stochastic target/draft
  `top_k` slot metadata after clearing streams and row formats; the new
  `V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy.ClearCacheDropsStochasticDistributionSlotMetadata`
  guard locks that contract in.
- [x] CUDA/ROCm device-resident publication is now covered by real-model
  Qwen3.6 MoE M2/M3/M4 continuation tests when the verifier itself stays on the
  decode-equivalent MoE expert path. This proves the publication transaction
  and device logical-state handoff are not the current grouped-promotion
  blocker. The production capability remains conservative until the grouped
  routed/shared verifier graph, stochastic lane, and benchmark economics are
  accepted together.
- [x] CPU trained/generated M=2/3/4 verifier GEMV/GEMM dispatch tables cover
  all supported Q/K/IQ codebooks, pass strict serial M=1 equivalence, and are
  wired into dense/GDN/LM-head/MoE verifier paths. Dense/GDN qwen36-core,
  LM-head, and MoE expert NativeVNNI rows are now generated and installed for
  all Q/K/IQ codebooks with fail-closed required-key validation and strict
  cosine, relative L2, symmetric KL, and max-absolute proof.
- [ ] CUDA trained/generated M=2/3/4 verifier GEMV/GEMM dispatch tables cover
  all supported Q/K/IQ codebooks, pass strict serial M=1 equivalence, are graph
  capturable, and are wired into dense/GDN/LM-head/MoE verifier paths. The
  refresh wrapper now has a direct CUDA `qwen36-moe` dry-run guard proving the
  real `35BMoE_Expert_GateUp` and `35BMoE_Expert_Down` buckets, M=2/3/4, and
  CUDA strict-generation thresholds are wired into the turnkey trainer profile;
  focused `V2_Integration_CUDAGemmParity` rows also pass 14/14 for all native
  small-M formats plus Qwen3.6 GDN/FFN fused verifier shapes. The remaining
  gate is not just route correctness:
  full acceptance still requires fresh generated artifacts plus parity and
  decode benchmark evidence.
- [x] ROCm trained/generated M=2/3/4 verifier GEMV/GEMM dispatch tables cover
  all supported Q/K/IQ codebooks, pass strict serial M=1 equivalence, are graph
  capturable, and are wired into dense/GDN/LM-head/MoE verifier paths. The
  Qwen3.6 fused QKV shape (`12288x5120`) is now in the turnkey ROCm/CUDA
  trainer inventory and the ROCm decode table contains M=1..4 policies for all
  runtime codebooks. Decode-equivalent ROCm batched verifier groups now use a
  shared-row NativeVNNI kernel that decodes each packed weight block once per
  output tile while preserving serial-M1 split-K order. The single-projection
  dense/GDN/LM-head path now uses the same shared-decode strategy rather than
  re-decoding packed weights once per verifier row. Focused gates passed:
  `V2_Integration_ROCm_NativeVNNI_GEMV` all-codebook M=2/3/4 serial-equivalence,
  `V2_Integration_ROCmQuantisedGemmSmallM`,
  `Qwen36ROCmSingleDevicePrefixMTPParity.VerifierRowsGroupedDecodeEquivalentM[2-4]`,
  and `V2_Perf_DenseVerifierRows_ROCm`, with exact cosine, relative L2,
  symmetric KL, and max-absolute proof. The latest focused dense verifier
  microbench shows M2/M3/M4 total speedups of `1.29/1.66/1.85x` and forward-only
  speedups of `1.62/2.31/2.68x`.
- [x] ROCm decode dispatch generation now has a broad aspect/work fallback
  instead of exact-shape-only lookup. The checked-in
  `ROCmNativeVNNIDecodeDispatchGenerated.inc` is regenerated from the preserved
  Qwen3.6 staged CSV with 420 exact overlays and fallback coverage for 420/420
  trained packed-codebook rows; exact-candidate recovery through the fallback is
  377/420 (`89.76%`). Future refreshes must preserve this generalization path.
- [ ] Focused verifier perf harnesses show grouped path faster than serial
  fallback per backend and meet the native microkernel targets. CPU/CUDA/ROCm
  dense are accepted, with ROCm dense promoted after the shared-row verifier
  kernel; CUDA/ROCm MoE verifier microbenches are speed-positive. Full-pipeline
  MoE lanes remain open.
- [ ] Greedy temperature-zero requests with repetition/DRY penalties are
  performance-promoted beyond the safe shared sequential verifier. The current
  GPU implementation now selects all-position/grouped verification only when
  the runner advertises row-local verifier-logit penalty application, then
  applies first-token/draft-prefix sampler history to each comparison and bonus
  row before compact greedy outcome reduction. Focused
  `V2_Unit_MTPVerifierPolicy`, `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition`,
  `V2_Unit_DeviceGraphOrchestrator`, and `V2_Unit_RankOrchestrator` pass.
  CPU now has an explicit execution-device implementation for applying sparse
  penalties to CPU MTP/main/all-position logits; this is not a GPU fallback.
  The shared decode-equivalent catch-up sampler now receives the token just
  forwarded so verifier penalty history includes speculative replay rows.
  Model-level Qwen3.6 dense penalty-greedy parity passes on CPU, CUDA, and
  ROCm via `MTPPenaltyGreedyMatchesPyTorchDecodeTokens`. This checkbox remains
  open until benchmark evidence proves the promoted lane is economical for
  repetition/DRY requests.
- [ ] Full MTP benchmark matrix refreshed with perfstats and GPU stage timing.
- [x] Phase 10 status reconciled so correctness-only serial fallback cannot be
  mistaken for performant grouped verifier acceptance. `MTPVerifierEconomyLane`
  keeps serial fallback, grouped outcome, and direct publication as separate
  contracts; DGO and RankOrchestrator tests assert grouped MoE outcome evidence
  is not economical while publication is pending. CPU MoE replay units now
  cover M=2/3/4 with cosine, relative L2, symmetric KL, and max-absolute checks
  so this correctness lane is strict but still labelled non-economical.
- [ ] LocalTP sharded compact verifier reducers implemented and proven for
  greedy/stochastic dense lanes with strict distribution and continuation
  equivalence.
- [ ] GlobalTP/NodeLocalTP sharded compact verifier reducers implemented and
  proven for greedy/stochastic dense lanes with strict distribution and
  continuation equivalence.
- [ ] Sharded TP MoE/ExpertOverlay verifier reducers implemented or explicitly
  left red/amber as serial-fallback-only; no single-device compact reducer is
  allowed to advertise support for these lanes.

### Phase 10: Default-Enablement Evidence

Goal: decide rollout from measured correctness and speed, not optimism.

Work:

- Refresh the dashboard after every iteration.
- Compare CUDA against llama.cpp anchors and keep ROCm within the same class of
  speedup before considering backend acceptance.
- Capture CPU separately with realistic expectations but the same correctness
  gates.

Exit gate:

- Green requires correctness plus speed-positive MTP against same-run no-MTP
  baseline.
- Dense and MoE have separate acceptance records for greedy and stochastic.
- Any default enablement proposal names the exact backend/model/sampling lanes
  that passed parity and benchmark gates.

Current status:

- Grouped greedy device-resident publication is now implemented for dense
  CUDA/ROCm SingleDevice. The focused unit
  `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition.GroupedGreedyDeviceResidentPublicationAvoidsReplayAndCheckpoint`
  proves the runner no longer captures live checkpoints, restores, or performs
  sequential shifted replay on the promoted greedy path. The strict grouped
  verifier row gate
  `V2_Integration_Parity_Qwen36_(CUDA|ROCm)_SingleDevice_.*VerifierRowsGroupedDecodeEquivalentM[1-4]`
  now checks cosine, relative L2, symmetric KLD, max-abs error, and sampled
  token equality; all CUDA/ROCm M=1..4 rows pass with the max-abs gate active.
  The real-model dense MTP subset also passed fixed d1/d3, dynamic, benchmark
  prompt, and first-transaction parity on CUDA/ROCm.
- Fresh bounded dense GPU evidence lives at
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260619T_dense_grouped_greedy_refresh/single_dense_gpu`.
  CUDA dense SingleDevice is speed-positive: greedy baseline/d1/d2/d3/dynamic
  is `44.46/58.82/70.61/74.92/72.05 tok/s` (`1.69x` best) and stochastic is
  `44.47/57.07/55.44/53.08/53.29 tok/s` (`1.28x` best). ROCm dense
  SingleDevice is correctness-green but speed-amber: greedy is
  `31.30/33.78/34.08/39.74/39.79 tok/s` (`1.27x` best), while stochastic is
  `31.79/32.22/25.51/23.50/32.16 tok/s` (`1.01x` best). ROCm still drains
  roughly `586 ms` of compact request-summary/outcome wait on greedy d3 and
  roughly `895 ms` on stochastic d1/dynamic over the short capture, so the next
  dense target is removing or overlapping that host bridge/wait. CUDA dense is
  the current ratchet.
- The older full-dashboard refresh
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260619T_full_dashboard_refresh` remains
  useful for non-SingleDevice blockers: CUDA2 LocalTP dense greedy accepts zero
  MTP tokens, CUDA2 LocalTP stochastic MTP hard-fails as unsupported outside
  SingleDevice/LocalPP full-logit execution, ROCm2 LocalTP fixed d1 segfaults
  in `LocalTPContext::allreduceOnStream`, and CPU stochastic refresh was
  stopped after d1 per user direction because it was pathologically slow.
  SingleDevice MoE remains red/amber and follows dense cleanup.
- Phase 10 remains open as the active performance/default-readiness phase.
  Current full-pipeline benchmark evidence is red/amber rather than
  default-ready: the next sprint must restore economical grouped verifier paths
  in the production benchmark, then fix LocalTP correctness before any rollout
  claim.
- The post-direct-publication shifted-cache crash is fixed. The root cause was
  a host-side depth-0 shifted MTP KV mirror that under-advanced relative to the
  device-resident metadata publication target; host adoption and the
	  `MTPSpecKVPublisher` unit now use the same `main_tokens - (mtp_depth + 1)`
	  invariant as the GPU metadata path. Focused
	  `V2_Unit_MTPSpecKVPublisher` and `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition` pass.
	  The stale MoE stochastic parity helper now derives the expected publication
	  contract from topology: CUDA/ROCm SingleDevice expect direct publication,
	  while CPU and ExpertOverlay remain fail-closed. The focused CUDA/ROCm MoE
	  Prefix+MTP direct-publication, stochastic, and prefix-restore subset passes
	  11/11 after this correction.
	  The fresh bounded sweep
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260618T141544Z_phase10_moe_direct_publication_post_shifted_fix`
  completes CUDA/ROCm MoE stochastic baseline plus fixed d1/d2/d3/dynamic
  without cache-shape failures, but remains speed-red: CUDA best d3 is
  14.1 tok/s versus 130.9 baseline and ROCm best d3 is 9.6 tok/s versus 78.9.
  The next Phase 10 sprint should therefore attack verifier MoE expert FFN,
  checkpoint export/import, and resident outcome wait economics rather than
  correctness or shifted-cache plumbing.
- Fresh MoE stochastic request-batch evidence confirms correctness without
  performance acceptance. Scalar RB=1 remains speed-negative on the default
  prompt (`20260613T100145Z-moe-stochastic-single-rb1`: CUDA best d3 83.8
  versus 114.6 tok/s baseline; ROCm best dynamic 53.0 versus 69.0). RB=2 is
  worse (`20260613T100431Z-moe-stochastic-single-rb2`: CUDA best d1 70.2
  versus 115.2; ROCm best d1 46.5 versus 69.1, with d2/d3 acceptance around
  4-12%). The next Phase 10 sprint should reduce MoE stochastic
  verifier/condition-token cost in the scalar path before revisiting larger
  request batches.
- Long-lane RB=1 evidence sharpens, but does not close, the gap:
  `20260613T101458Z-moe-stochastic-long-rb1` shows CUDA fixed d3 nearly neutral
  at 136.4 versus 138.6 tok/s baseline, and ROCm fixed d2 neutral at
  77.0 versus 77.0 tok/s baseline while ROCm dynamic remains poor at 62.0. A
  generated-depth-policy refresh using that evidence was benchmark-rejected
  (`20260613T_phase10_depth_policy_refresh_rocm_moe_stoch`): ROCm dynamic still
  demoted back to d1 and reached only 60.3 versus 77.7 tok/s baseline. The
  checked-in generated table therefore remains unchanged; the promoted slice is
  only the trainer grouping/interval regression.
- Fresh GPU-stage timing for MoE stochastic RB=1
  (`20260613T_phase10_moe_stochastic_gpu_stage_deep`) shows the remaining
  economics clearly: CUDA fixed d3 reaches 137.1 versus 138.6 tok/s baseline
  with 808 ms verifier and 255 ms condition time; ROCm fixed d3 reaches 84.6
  versus 77.7 tok/s baseline in the instrumented run, but still spends 1287 ms
  in verifier, 357 ms in condition, and 265 ms in device outcome/D2H summary.
  This evidence is useful for attribution, not default acceptance, because the
  run enabled GPU stage timing. The focused unit regression
  `RequestBatchedStochasticDepthThreeUsesLogicalPositionDraws` now pins RB=2
  stochastic accept/residual/bonus RNG positions against the scalar contract, so
  poor request-batch acceptance is no longer treated as an obvious descriptor
  drift bug.
- Phase 10 now tracks `stochastic_device_physical_verify_rows`,
  `stochastic_device_semantic_verify_rows`, and
  `stochastic_device_post_reject_rows` for both scalar and request-batched
  device stochastic outcome paths. `scripts/summarize_mtp_perfstats.py` and the
  standard benchmark matrix now surface them as
  `stochastic_physical_verify_rows`, `stochastic_semantic_verify_rows`, and
  `stochastic_post_reject_rows`, so this signal is present in every future
  `summary.tsv`. These counters make the next optimization decision observable:
  if post-rejection verifier rows dominate, split accept-count discovery from
  residual correction so only the first rejected row pays correction sampling;
  if not, prioritize verifier graph and condition replay cost directly.
- The first clean counter-bearing MoE stochastic pass
  (`20260613T_phase10_moe_stochastic_row_counters`) keeps both CUDA and ROCm
  below baseline: CUDA d2/d3 reaches 124.9/132.9 tok/s versus 138.4 baseline
  with only 7/132 and 19/157 post-reject rows, while ROCm d2/d3 reaches
  58.3/62.2 tok/s versus 77.0 baseline with 45/158 and 75/198 post-reject
  rows. This moves the next slice away from generic sampler-table work and
  toward ROCm outcome synchronization plus condition/rejection economics.
- `DeviceSpeculativeOutcomeHandle` is now the Phase 10 resident-outcome
  contract. `DeviceGraphOrchestrator` can enqueue a request-batched stochastic
  verifier summary and return runner-owned device pointers plus the explicit
  verifier stream without copying metadata to host. The existing
  `verifyStochasticDistributionsRequestBatchOutcomesOnDevice()` method is now a
  compatibility wrapper over resident enqueue plus
  `copyDeviceSpeculativeOutcomesToHost()`. The scalar host-returning stochastic
  APIs now build a one-request descriptor, enqueue the resident handle, and use
  the same explicit host bridge, with `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition` pinning
  host-first and device-first descriptor construction. This does not yet remove
  the scalar hot-path D2H boundary; it gives the next publication slice a
  concrete handle to consume for accepted-state publish and next-token staging.
- The resident-outcome host bridge now queues compact output-token and metadata
  D2H copies with `deviceToHostOnStream()` on the verifier stream, uses
  persistent backend-pinned host scratch for the compatibility copy target, and
  performs a single `synchronizeStream()` handoff. CUDA and ROCm reject null
  streams for stream-aware H2D/D2H copies, and
  `V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy` guards against regressing this bridge
  back to multiple `deviceToHostFast()` synchronizations. The bridge now also
  reports `stochastic_batch_d2h_enqueue_ms` and
  `stochastic_batch_d2h_wait_ms` next to the legacy total sync column so ROCm
  attribution can distinguish actual compact-copy enqueue cost from deferred
  GPU work drained at the handoff.
- A bounded MoE stochastic refresh after that slice,
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260613T121236Z-iteration-matrix-a6a69ec8`,
  remains speed-negative: CUDA best dynamic is 85.1 tok/s versus 115.1
  baseline, and ROCm best fixed d3 is 58.1 tok/s versus 69.0 baseline. CUDA is
  primarily verifier/condition limited in this capture. ROCm still drains a
  large amount of deferred GPU work at the compact outcome host boundary
  (`stochastic_request_batch_summary_d2h_sync` is 235 ms for d3 and over
  400 ms for d1/dynamic), so the next ROCm slice should move resident outcome
  consumption into device-side publication/continuation rather than adding more
  host copies. Completely removing the D2H boundary requires a device-resident
  scheduler/output contract that can carry sampled tokens across steps before
  flushing host-visible responses.
- A follow-up after persistent pinned host scratch,
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260613T123247Z-iteration-matrix-a6a69ec8`,
  confirms the diagnosis: enqueue is now tiny, but total boundary cost remains
  speed-negative because the wait drains producer-stream work. CUDA dynamic is
  83.6 tok/s versus 115.3 baseline with D2H 23.8 ms split into 0.2 ms enqueue
  plus 23.5 ms wait. ROCm dynamic is 55.2 tok/s versus 69.1 baseline with D2H
  405 ms split into 0.2 ms enqueue plus 404 ms wait. The next Phase 10
  implementation target is device-resident accepted-state publication and
  continuation-token staging from `DeviceSpeculativeOutcomeHandle`, not more
  host-copy tuning.
- The scalar all-position stochastic branch now calls the resident verifier
  APIs directly, keeps the resulting `DeviceSpeculativeOutcomeHandle` visible
  in `OrchestrationRunner`, and then invokes the host bridge only as an explicit
  compatibility step. `V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy` guards that the
  runner branch does not regress to the legacy host-returning verifier API, and
  `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition` now serializes/parses compact resident rows
  in its mock runner. This is a structural step toward device-side publication;
  it does not remove the host boundary yet.
- The Phase 10 summary surface now exposes runner-level
  `resident_outcome_enqueue_ms` and `resident_outcome_host_bridge_ms` in
  addition to compact D2H enqueue/wait. This keeps future matrices honest about
  whether a slice moved work onto the device or merely renamed the same
  synchronization boundary. The next real implementation slice is a
  device-side publication/token-mailbox contract: compact outcome metadata must
  drive accepted-state row selection, KV truncation, terminal-hidden restore,
  and next-token staging without copying the outcome to host first. The
  existing host bridge should then become an output flush, not the state
  mutation dependency.
- Fresh diagnostic evidence with those columns,
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260613T125826Z-iteration-matrix-a6a69ec8`,
  keeps MoE stochastic red: CUDA dynamic is 78.8 tok/s versus 114.6 baseline,
  with 1.0 ms resident enqueue and 23.9 ms host bridge; ROCm dynamic is
  55.4 tok/s versus 69.2 baseline, with 1.4 ms resident enqueue and
  405.1 ms host bridge. This proves the next slice must remove the state
  dependency on the host bridge instead of further tuning compact copy enqueue.
- Phase 10 now has the runner/orchestrator contract for that removal:
  `DeviceSpeculativePublicationRequest` carries the compact
  `DeviceSpeculativeOutcomeHandle` plus host-known verifier shape invariants;
  pre-verifier base-cache counts live in device metadata. The only supported
  direct-publication entry point is
  `publishAcceptedMTPSpecStateBatchFromDeviceOutcome()`. Scalar
  `OrchestrationRunner` calls it before `copyDeviceSpeculativeOutcomesToHost()`;
  request-batched stochastic calls it before host response materialization, then
  adopts host mirrors from `DeviceResidentLogicalSequenceStateHandle` metadata
  through `DeviceResidentHostStateAdoptionRequest`. The compatibility host
  bridge is now only a served-token and sampler-bookkeeping flush, not a
  planning or live-state mutation dependency.
  Focused gate:
  `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition` and
  `V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy`.
- A follow-up code dive confirmed why DGO cannot safely advertise the new
  capability yet: `MTPSpecStatePublisher`, `GDNRecurrenceStage`, and
  `ShortConv1dStage` still restore verifier state from a host integer row, and
  DGO positions/sequence lengths are host-owned. The next implementation slice
  is a device-indexed publication primitive: derive accepted restore rows and
  target cache counts from compact metadata on the verifier stream, restore
  GDN/short-conv snapshots by device row index, and only later flush host-visible
  output tokens.
- Device-indexed verifier-state publication is now implemented as the first
  piece of that primitive. `IComputeStage`, `GDNRecurrenceStage`, and
  `ShortConv1dStage` expose
  `restoreVerifierStateCaptureRowFromDeviceIndex()`, and CUDA/ROCm GDN kernels
  copy captured recurrence/short-conv rows by reading the row index on the
  caller's explicit stream. `MTPSpecStatePublisher` can publish graph or vector
  stage state from a device row pointer and hard-fails CPU devices, null row
  pointers, or null/default streams. Focused gate passed:
  `V2_Unit_MTPSpecStateContract` and
  `V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy`. This unblocked later DGO resident
  publication once compact metadata also drove cache-count mutation,
  terminal-hidden row selection, and next-token staging.
- Compact outcome row/count derivation is now shared in
  `sampling_math::derive_speculative_publication_metadata()`. The helper uses
  `kSpecBatchMetaTargetVerifierStateCommitCount`, not
  `kSpecBatchMetaAcceptedSpeculativePrefix`, so reject-first stochastic steps
  still publish verifier row zero and advance one cache token. Focused tests in
  `V2_Unit_MTPSpecDecodeMetadata` cover accept-all, reject-first, and invalid
  commit-count metadata. CUDA/ROCm now expose
  `enqueueDeriveSpeculativePublicationMetadata()`, a graph-captured backend
  kernel that writes derived restore rows, target cached-token counts, accepted
  state counts, and validity flags from device-resident compact metadata plus
  device-resident base-cache counts. `V2_Integration_GPUSamplingKernels` covers
  accept-all, reject-first, invalid metadata, null-stream rejection, and graph
  capture on both GPU backends. `MTPSpecDecodeMetadataWorkspaceBinding` now
  declares and binds base cached-token, target cached-token, and
  publication-validity buffers so DGO can own the handoff through normal
  workspace allocation instead of ad hoc device allocations. DGO now also has
  an unpromoted terminal-hidden row-select helper that points
  `HiddenStateRowsSelectStage` at
  `MTPSpecDecodeWorkspaceBuffers::ACCEPTED_STATE_SLOT_INDICES` with external
  device metadata, so accepted terminal rows can be selected without host row
  uploads once the direct publication path is enabled. The next Phase 10
  implementation slice is KV count handoff, next-token staging, and DGO
  consumption without requiring
  `copyDeviceSpeculativeOutcomesToHost()` before live-state mutation.
- DGO now has the matching unpromoted publication-metadata preflight. It
  validates the resident outcome against the last all-position verifier graph,
  snapshots pre-verifier base cached-token counts from the KV cache's
  device-owned sequence metadata into the persistent MTP metadata workspace,
  and launches `enqueueDeriveSpeculativePublicationMetadata()` on that same
  verifier stream. The old host base-count upload is forbidden; a missing
  device count pointer is a hard coherence failure. That same shared CUDA/ROCm
  derivation now writes
  `NEXT_CONDITION_TOKENS`: it prefers the sampled terminal ready token when the
  verifier accepted every row, otherwise it uses the last committed compact
  output token. `V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy` guards that the helper
  uses the verifier stream, graph workspace allocation, backend derivation,
  pre-verifier D2D base-cache snapshot, and no compatibility D2H bridge, host
  base-count H2D, or stream sync. `V2_Unit_MTPSpecDecodeMetadata` and
  `V2_Integration_GPUSamplingKernels` cover the next-token rule on CPU math,
  CUDA, and ROCm graph capture. DGO still must not advertise resident
  publication until KV cache truncation and logical positions/sequence lengths
  consume those device buffers atomically.
- The cache-side handoff is now named in `IKVCache` as
  `DeviceSequenceStatePublicationRequest`. It requires device-resident target
  cached-token counts, accepted-state counts, publication-ok flags, and an
  explicit stream. The contract documents the long-context ring-cache hazard:
  target count alone cannot recover a wrapped ring head, so implementations need
  a device-visible base head/count mirror. DGO's direct publication endpoint now
  checks `supportsDeviceResidentSequenceStatePublication()` and hard-fails with
  that exact reason before any compatibility host bridge can run. The next
  Phase 10 slice is implementing that GPU cache mirror and teaching attention
  dynamic params to consume it.
- The first mirror slice is in place for regular CUDA/ROCm ring KV caches:
  `deviceCachedTokenCountPtr()` and `deviceRingHeadPtr()` expose backend-neutral
  device pointers, and graph-captured dynamic append enqueues a tiny
  stream-ordered state-advance kernel after writing KV rows. This keeps
  device-side count/head metadata coherent after replay without a D2H sync or a
  post-replay H2D upload. TQ and hybrid variants remain guarded unless they use
  the same dynamic append contract.
- CUDA/ROCm FP32 attention now has the matching unpromoted device-count path.
  `ITensorAttention::prepareDynamicAttnParamsFromDeviceSequenceState()` defaults
  false, while the GPU kernels enqueue a tiny count-to-`AttentionDeviceParams`
  derivation on the explicit stage stream. `AttentionComputeStage` records that
  derive step after KV append for regular GPU caches and leaves TQ/hybrid caches
  on their guarded metadata path. Resident publication is still disabled because
  accepted-state KV mutation, wrapped-ring-safe target heads, graph signatures,
  and DGO logical positions still need device-owned publication.
- The mirror path is coherent outside graph replay too: regular CUDA/ROCm
  append, logical import, and truncate now refresh device head/count mirrors on
  explicit streams after host-owned mutations. This prevents the new
  device-count attention path from reading stale metadata during non-captured
  GPU execution while keeping captured append replay on the device-advance
  kernel.
- Regular CUDA/ROCm ring KV caches now have the next unpromoted cache-side
  publication primitive:
  `publishSequenceStateFromDeviceMetadata()` validates the device metadata
  request and enqueues a tiny wrapped-ring-safe head/count publication kernel on
  the verifier stream. The kernel preserves the current live ring tail and
  writes the new head as `tail + target_cached_tokens[request]`, while using
  `accepted_state_counts[request]` only as accepted-row metadata. This mirrors
  ordinary cache truncation after verifier rows have already been written and
  prevents rejected rows from leaking into the next decode step.
  `V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy` guards the CUDA/ROCm symmetry,
  explicit-stream requirement, publication-ok gating, and DGO's continued
  refusal to advertise resident publication until logical positions and
  sequence lengths are also device-owned.
- DGO now has a separate
  `supportsDeviceResidentLogicalSequenceStatePublication()` gate before any
  cache-side device publication is enqueued. This keeps the Phase 10 handoff
  atomic: if regular CUDA/ROCm KV caches later advertise device sequence-state
  publication, direct resident publication still hard-fails before KV mutation
  until DGO positions, `sequence_lengths()`, and graph-signature inputs are
  backed by a real device-owned mailbox. `V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy`
  guards the ordering as cache-support gate, DGO logical-state gate, then KV
  mutation.
- The first DGO logical-state mailbox slice is in place. After resident compact
  outcome metadata is derived, DGO records a
  `DeviceResidentLogicalSequenceStateMailbox` that wraps device target cached
  tokens as both next position and sequence length, carries device next-token
  and publication-ok buffers, preserves the explicit producer stream, records a
  backend readiness event, and is invalidated on request/session resets. DGO now
  exposes the mailbox through a typed
  `DeviceResidentLogicalSequenceStateHandle` and queues an event wait from the
  forward-graph live-state prelude without synchronizing the host. Reset API
  comments now distinguish the request-boundary `clear_cache()` contract from
  destructive graph/workspace teardown. The support gate remains false until
  `get_position()`, `sequence_lengths()`, and graph signatures consume that
  mailbox directly.
- The next mailbox-consumer prerequisite is now in place: generic
  `ForwardInput`, `MTPForwardInput`, Qwen/Qwen3.5 graph helpers, `RoPEStage`,
  and CUDA/ROCm RoPE kernels understand device-resident INT32 position rows.
  Host explicit positions still pre-upload through the workspace before graph
  capture, but resident position rows bind directly through
  `setDynamicDevicePositionIds()` and are rejected on null/default streams.
  `V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy` guards that this path does not hide an
  H2D copy, while the Phase 10 focused gate
  `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition`,
  `V2_Unit_MTPPerfStatsSummary`,
  `V2_Unit_MTPIterationBenchmarkMatrix`,
  `V2_Unit_MTPSpecStateContract`,
  `V2_Unit_MTPSpecDecodeMetadata`,
  `V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy`, and
  `V2_Integration_GPUSamplingKernels` passed on this slice. DGO resident
  publication remains disabled until the mailbox also feeds graph signatures,
  `get_position()`, and `sequence_lengths()` without host synchronization.
- DGO graph-session plumbing now has explicit `withDevicePositionIds()` hooks
  for full-forward and attention subgraph builds, and the attention-session API
  passes host and device position inputs separately into `buildAttentionGraph`.
  `V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy` guards this structural handoff so
  future mailbox consumers do not collapse resident positions back into an
  implicit host-position path.
- Cached forward replay now refreshes explicit RoPE position rows through the
  common `IComputeStage` dynamic-position hook. The forward graph signature
  distinguishes device-resident position mode, GPU resident position rows count
  as stable replay inputs, and cache-hit replay refreshes either host explicit
  rows or the device pointer before graph capture/replay. This closes the
  position-row replay prerequisite, but Phase 10 direct resident publication
  still remains disabled until host `sequence_lengths()`/`get_position()`
  consumers are removed from the accepted-state path.
- MTP sidecar replay can now consume the resident logical-state mailbox through
  `forwardMTPFromDeviceResidentLogicalStateForDeviceSampling()`. DGO rejects
  non-owned or stale handles by checking device, epoch, stream, event, and
  mailbox pointers, then feeds `next_condition_tokens_device` plus
  `target_positions_device` into the normal sidecar graph path. The sidecar
  executor waits on the mailbox readiness event on its explicit stream and
  refreshes device position rows through `IComputeStage` before replay. Rank
  delegation is intentionally single-child only until LocalTP/PP have a
  domain-wide mailbox map. This is still unpromoted because the call retains a
  host shadow position for scalar metadata and the stochastic planner still
  copies compact outcomes to host after resident publication.
- Phase 10 mailbox ownership is now structural instead of open-coded at each
  consumer. `DeviceResidentLogicalSequenceStateHandle` owns request-bounds and
  row-pointer helpers, while DGO's mailbox owns the stream/event/pointer/epoch
  identity check. The sidecar consumer now uses those helpers before deriving
  request-local token and position rows, which keeps future getter,
  sequence-length, and scheduler consumers from drifting into partial
  ownership checks. Focused gate:
  `V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy`,
  `V2_Unit_MTPSpecDecodeMetadata`, and
  `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition`.
- The resident sidecar path no longer reads `state_.positions` as a scalar
  crutch. Dynamic stages now expose
  `supportsDeviceResidentDynamicPositionReplay()`: RoPE, embedding, KV append,
  GDN, and short-conv declare that they ignore or consume device position rows,
  while attention opts in only for regular GPU KV caches with device cached-token
  mirrors. The sidecar validates that support before binding resident rows and
  passes a neutral scalar to `updateDynamicParams()` in device-position mode.
  This keeps unsupported TQ/hybrid attention hard-failed instead of silently
  falling back to stale host state. Focused gate:
  `V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy`,
  `V2_Unit_MTPSpecDecodeMetadata`,
  `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition`, and
  `V2_Integration_GPUSamplingKernels`.
- Direct device-resident publication now has the matching host-mirror adoption
  boundary. `IInferenceRunner::adoptDeviceResidentMTPSpecPublishedHostState()`
  refreshes `get_position()`/`sequence_lengths()` from the already-built
  `MTPSpecStepPlanBatch` after the compact outcome host bridge, without calling
  the host KV/state publisher again. DGO ties this adoption to the current
  logical-state mailbox and refuses to synchronize or mutate KV. The runner's
  direct-publication branch now calls adoption instead of leaving host getters
  stale after skipping `publishAcceptedMTPSpecStateBatch()`. Focused gate:
  `V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy`,
  `V2_Unit_MTPSpecDecodeMetadata`,
  `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition`, and
  `V2_Integration_GPUSamplingKernels`.
- MTP sidecar position planning now has a single guarded host-mirror read
  boundary. `IInferenceRunner::hostLogicalStateMirrorsDeviceResidentState()`
  lets DGO report whether a current resident logical-state mailbox has been
  adopted into host-visible `get_position()`/`sequence_lengths()` mirrors.
  Recording a mailbox marks those mirrors stale, adopting the validated step
  plan marks the same live-state epoch fresh, and
  `OrchestrationRunner::currentMTPBaseSidecarPositionForPlanning()` refuses
  speculative planning if a caller would read stale host logical state. Focused
  gate:
  `V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy`,
  `V2_Unit_MTPSpecDecodeMetadata`,
  `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition`, and
  `V2_Integration_GPUSamplingKernels`.
- Direct device-resident KV/logical publication is now enabled for GPU ring
  caches that expose device head/count mirrors. CUDA and ROCm ring bases
  advertise `supportsDeviceResidentSequenceStatePublication()` only when both
  mirrors exist, publish device metadata on the verifier stream, and implement
  `adoptSequenceStateFromHostMetadata()` so wrapped-ring host heads/counts match
  the already-enqueued device update without extra GPU work. DGO now returns
  success from `publishAcceptedMTPSpecStateBatchFromDeviceOutcome()` after KV
  device publication and resident mailbox recording, then the later adoption
  bridge refreshes both KV host mirrors and DGO positions from the validated
  step plan. The remaining Phase 10 bridge is compact outcome and transaction
  output materialization, not KV/position publication.
- The all-position stochastic runner path now calls
  `materializeDeviceSpeculativeOutcomesForHostResponse()` instead of the raw
  `copyDeviceSpeculativeOutcomesToHost()` hook. This is a structural ownership
  marker: resident state publication happens first from device metadata, while
  host materialization is only for emitted response tokens and the temporary
  host adoption/transaction-plan invariant. Focused gate:
  `V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy`,
  `V2_Unit_MTPSpecDecodeMetadata`, and
  `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition`.
- Direct resident publication for dense/supported GPU runners now includes
  shifted MTP KV caches in the same atomic handoff as the main KV cache.
  CUDA/ROCm derive per-depth shifted target counts and wrapped-head deltas from
  compact verifier metadata on the verifier stream, publish each shifted cache
  through the same
  `DeviceSequenceStatePublicationRequest` contract, and adopt matching host
  mirrors from the validated step plan. DGO now records the logical mailbox
  readiness event only after main and shifted KV publication kernels are
  enqueued, so sidecar consumers wait for the full state update instead of only
  metadata derivation. MoE remains excluded from this promotion until shifted
  sidecar KV rows can be synthesized or reused under strict parity. Focused gate
  passed:
  `V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy`,
  `V2_Unit_MTPSpecDecodeMetadata`,
  `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition`,
  `V2_Integration_GPUSamplingKernels`, and exact Qwen3.6 CUDA/ROCm
  SingleDevice stochastic Prefix+MTP parity.
- Rejected-token correction shifted commits now consume the same resident
  logical-state mailbox. `IInferenceRunner`,
  `DeviceGraphOrchestrator`, and `RankOrchestrator` expose
  `commitMTPShiftedRowFromDeviceResidentLogicalState()`, which validates the
  mailbox owner/epoch, waits on its readiness event on an explicit stream, reads
  `NEXT_CONDITION_TOKENS` on device, and appends the shifted MTP row without
  using the host-materialized compact token. Multi-participant TP remains a hard
  fail until a domain-wide logical mailbox exists. Focused gate passed:
  `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition`,
  `V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy`, exact Qwen3.6 CUDA/ROCm SingleDevice
  stochastic Prefix+MTP parity, and the bounded CUDA/ROCm MoE stochastic sweep
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260613T_phase10_resident_correction_token`.
  The sweep keeps MoE stochastic speed-negative: CUDA best fixed d2 is
  75.8 tok/s versus 114.7 baseline and ROCm best fixed d3 is 54.3 tok/s versus
  68.8 baseline. CUDA's compact bridge is now sub-ms, so CUDA remains
  verifier/condition limited; ROCm still drains about 261 ms at the outcome
  boundary in the best lane.
- The resident logical-state mailbox now carries accepted-state counts as a
  first-class device pointer alongside target positions, sequence lengths,
  next-condition tokens, and publication-ok flags. The accepted-state count is
  the correction replay boundary after a stochastic rejection, so future
  transaction-output consumers can reason from device metadata rather than
  rebuilding that boundary from host-materialized compact outcomes. Focused gate
  passed: `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition` and
  `V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy`.
- Resident stochastic outcomes now carry a response-ready event recorded on the
  producer stream immediately after compact verifier rows are ready and before
  any direct state-publication work can enqueue behind them. The compatibility
  host bridge creates its own explicit response stream, waits on that event,
  copies compact output tokens/metadata, and synchronizes only that bridge
  stream; synchronizing the producer stream is now guarded as a regression.
  Focused gate passed: `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition`,
  `V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy`, and exact Qwen3.6 CUDA/ROCm
  SingleDevice stochastic Prefix+MTP parity. The bounded MoE stochastic sweep
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260613T_phase10_response_ready_event`
  remains speed-negative: CUDA best fixed d2 is 71.9 tok/s versus 113.7
  baseline, while ROCm best fixed d3 is 51.9 tok/s versus 66.9 baseline. CUDA
  is verifier/condition limited with sub-ms bridge time. ROCm still reports a
  large bridge wait, which now reflects waiting for compact summary/verifier
  work itself rather than extra state publication queued after the response
  event. The next Phase 10 implementation target remains device-side
  transaction/output planning and lower verifier/condition cost, not more
  compact-copy enqueue tuning.
- A fixed-depth-only MoE stochastic stage-timing pass
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260613T_phase10_fixed_depth_stage_timing`
  confirms that dynamic-controller tuning is not the current floor. CUDA best
  fixed d1/d2 is about 73.9 tok/s versus 113.5 baseline, with 297-314 ms of
  verifier time and 220-221 ms of condition-forward time over the short lane.
  ROCm best fixed d1 is 42.5 tok/s versus 68.1 baseline, with 415-495 ms
  verifier time, 273-323 ms condition-forward time, and bridge waits that still
  drain real compact summary/verifier producer work. The next Phase 10 target
  is vLLM-style pending-condition verifier rows: after a stochastic rejection,
  carry the correction token as the first input row of the next target verifier
  transaction and draft from the accepted-prefix state, instead of running that
  correction token through a standalone one-token main `condition_forward`
  before sidecar drafting. Controller polishing is explicitly deferred until
  fixed d1/d2/d3 lanes become speed-positive.
- vLLM-style pending-condition verifier rows are now implemented for stochastic
  all-position publication. After a rejection, the correction token is carried
  as row zero of the next target verifier transaction, sidecar drafting starts
  from the accepted-prefix state, and only newly generated tokens are emitted
  or recorded. Focused gates passed:
  `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition` plus the adjacent
  `V2_Unit_(MTPDecodeCatchup|MTPSpecDecodeMetadata|MTPSpecTransactionPlan|MTPRejectionSampler)`
  cluster. The bounded fixed-depth MoE stochastic refresh
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260613T_phase10_pending_condition_rows`
  shows the standalone condition-forward tax is gone (`condition_ms=0` on
  CUDA and ROCm), but Phase 10 remains red: CUDA best fixed d2 is
  77.5 tok/s versus 113.3 baseline, and ROCm best fixed d3 is 47.1 tok/s
  versus 68.3 baseline. The next fixed-depth target is no longer correction
  replay. CUDA is verifier, accepted-state publication, and outcome limited;
  ROCm has the same verifier/publication cost and additionally drains large
  compact outcome work at the response bridge for d1/d2. Keep dynamic-policy
  work parked until those fixed-depth lanes are speed-positive.
- Direct resident publication now mirrors the normal publication contract for
  the active single-request GPU path: it waits for shifted MTP KV readiness,
  publishes main and shifted KV from device-derived counts, restores
  GDN/short-conv verifier capture rows from device `accepted_state_slot_indices`,
  selects terminal hidden from the same device metadata, advances the live
  replay epoch, and only then records the resident logical-state mailbox. The
  direct device-resident stochastic lane now also skips success-path live
  rollback checkpoint capture and carries only a logical base stamp, matching
  the intended vLLM-style atomic transaction shape.
  Focused gates passed:
  `V2_Unit_(PrefillDecodeTransition|GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy)`, the
  adjacent MTP transaction/state unit cluster, and exact CUDA/ROCm Qwen3.6 MoE
  SingleDevice `MTPStochasticSamplingVerifierRuns`. The bounded probe
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260613T194327Z_phase10_checkpoint_skip_probe`
  shows checkpoint time is now zero and direct publication remains bounded
  (CUDA about 12-15 ms, ROCm about 23-27 ms over the short lane), while the
  remaining hot boundary is still the host-visible stochastic outcome/plan
  bridge plus verifier work, especially on ROCm.
  `V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy` now guards that this endpoint cannot
  regress to KV-only publication before the mailbox.
  A clean same-run non-profiling check,
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260613T194526Z_phase10_checkpoint_skip_same_run`,
  keeps the lane unaccepted: CUDA fixed d3 is effectively break-even
  (128.4 tok/s versus 128.3 baseline), while ROCm remains negative
  (best fixed d3 66.1 tok/s versus 72.1 baseline). The next fixed-depth slice
  should consume device-resident transaction output directly and reduce the
  verifier/outcome boundary instead of polishing dynamic-depth policy,
  reintroducing host-plan dependencies, or restoring success-path checkpoints.
- The stochastic host response bridge now reuses a persistent explicit GPU
  stream instead of creating and destroying a CUDA/HIP stream on every decode
  step. This keeps the no-null-stream contract while removing a ROCm-visible
  runtime setup cost from fixed-depth MTP. Focused gates passed:
  `V2_Unit_(GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy|PrefillDecodeTransition|MTPPerfStatsSummary|MTPIterationBenchmarkMatrix)`
  plus exact CUDA/ROCm Qwen3.6 MoE SingleDevice stochastic Prefix+MTP parity.
  The bounded probe
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260613T195903Z_phase10_persistent_bridge_stream_probe`
  shows measured rows have zero bridge-stream creation time and only stream
  reuses. The clean same-run check
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260613T200052Z_phase10_persistent_bridge_stream_same_run`
  still leaves Phase 10 red: CUDA fixed d3 is break-even
  (128.7 tok/s versus 128.8 baseline), and ROCm improves but remains negative
  (best fixed d2 69.5 tok/s versus 74.1 baseline). The next fixed-depth target
  is therefore verifier/compact-outcome producer latency and device-resident
  transaction output, not stream allocation, checkpoint capture, or dynamic
  controller tuning.
- The resident stochastic verifier-input path now skips the final sidecar flush
  before target verification when all verifier inputs are backed by device
  sample-ready events. This removes a real host-visible sync without changing
  served inference semantics: `decodeStep()` still returns actual emitted token
  ids, and benchmark mode still exercises that same contract. Focused gates
  passed: `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition`,
  `V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy`, and release `llaminar2`. The ROCm
  MoE stochastic d1 probe
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260613T203857Z-phase10-skip-sidecar-flush-rocm-moe-d1`
  shows the skip counter firing for every verifier step and improves fixed d1
  to 70.4 tok/s versus a 77.3 tok/s baseline, but Phase 10 remains red. The
  outcome bridge still waits about 2081 ms over the measured lane because it is
  mostly waiting on queued GPU producer work, not copying compact bytes.
- Do not add benchmark-only token-count shortcuts. The verifier bonus token is
  a host-visible output prediction, but live model state has only advanced
  through the accepted verifier input prefix; the bonus token must still be
  forwarded as a later condition before it can become published state. The
  vLLM-aligned next step is therefore a resident next-input/output boundary:
  served inference may stream compact token ids to the host at real output
  boundaries, while the next main decode/sidecar input consumes the same token
  from a device-resident slot instead of round-tripping through a CPU shadow.
- The served-inference resident input boundary is now active for the scalar GPU
  stochastic lane. Rejected corrections and bonus-ready verifier tokens both
  preserve a resident logical-state mailbox, and the next sidecar consumes that
  mailbox rather than re-uploading the host-visible token shadow. The regression
  keeps compatibility host-plan publication and direct device-resident
  publication as separate contracts. Focused gates passed:
  `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition` and
  `V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy`.
  The narrow ROCm MoE stochastic d1 check
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260613T211306Z-phase10-resident-ready-rocm-moe-d1`
  is near break-even at 76.5 tok/s versus a 77.6 tok/s baseline, with
  resident-ready handoff used 170 times and resident correction handoff 37
  times. The remaining hot timer is still the response-bound compact outcome
  wait: 4378 ms total over 210 verifier steps, while enqueue is only 1.6 ms.
  That points at verifier/summary producer latency exposed at the host response
  boundary, not compact-copy byte volume.
- The compact vLLM recovered-token verifier is now the accepted GPU stochastic
  one-hot draft primitive. CUDA/ROCm device-token batch verifier kernels can
  treat `q` as one-hot at the greedy draft token and sample rejected rows with
  vLLM-style inverse-exponential residual noise, without materializing a draft
  probability table. Focused
  `V2_(Unit_MTPRejectionSampler|Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition|Integration_GPUSamplingKernels)`
  gates pass. The ROCm MoE d1 check
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260613T_phase10_rocm_moe_compact_vllm_recovered_d1`
  restores acceptance versus the rejected compact-CDF shortcut (78.1%
  acceptance, 78.4 tok/s versus 77.9 baseline) but remains only break-even.
  vLLM source inspection confirms the next alignment target: keep sampled
  output tensors and transaction metadata device-owned, copy response tokens
  asynchronously for the serving layer, and remove the host-materialized
  transaction/adoption plan from the GPU state-mutation boundary.
- Resident logical-state metadata now carries device-side transaction
  predicates: all-drafts-accepted and stopped flags are derived in the same
  CUDA/ROCm graph-captured metadata pass as accepted counts, target cache
  counts, next-condition tokens, and validity. The DGO mailbox and typed
  `DeviceResidentLogicalSequenceStateHandle` expose those predicates with the
  same stream/event/epoch ownership contract, and the mock runner plus captured
  GPU sampling integration tests read them back. Focused gate passed:
  `V2_(Unit_(PrefillDecodeTransition|MTPSpecDecodeMetadata|GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy)|Integration_GPUSamplingKernels)`.
  This is a prerequisite for the next Phase 10 slice: graph-captured
  continuation/prelaunch must branch from resident predicates instead of
  materializing compact outcomes on the CPU to discover stop/all-accepted
  state.
- The first resident prelaunch overlap slice is implemented for the scalar GPU
  stochastic lane. Direct resident publication now enqueues the next first MTP
  sidecar from the resident logical-state mailbox before the compatibility
  compact-outcome host bridge materializes served tokens, including normal
  stop-token chat lanes. The following accepted-ready step reuses that sidecar
  instead of replaying shifted-cache work. Rejected lanes that do not expose a
  compatible ready/pending resident continuation drop stale prelaunches, and
  completed requests discard terminal-step prelaunches before they can affect
  response state. Focused gate passed:
  `V2_(Unit_(PrefillDecodeTransition|GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy|MTPPerfStatsSummary|MTPIterationBenchmarkMatrix)|Integration_GPUSamplingKernels)`.
  The iteration perfstats summary now exposes prelaunch enqueue time, launches,
  reuses, drops, and completed-request discards so real-model matrices can prove
  whether overlap is firing without confusing terminal waste for stale reuse.
- Seeded device-derived vLLM verifier thresholds were benchmark-rejected for
  production use. The isolated CUDA/ROCm primitive remains graph-capturable and
  unit/integration-equivalent, but the full served stochastic stream includes
  sampler state, bonus-token consumption, and recovered-token inverse sampling.
  On ROCm MoE d1, omitting explicit accept/residual threshold arrays collapsed
  default-seed acceptance to 8.6%. Production scalar and request-batched
  descriptors now always pass value-owned explicit thresholds until a shared
  end-to-end RNG stream contract is designed and proven. Focused gates passed:
  `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition`,
  `V2_Unit_MTPPerfStatsSummary`,
  `V2_Unit_MTPIterationBenchmarkMatrix`, and
  `V2_Integration_GPUSamplingKernels`. The corrective benchmark
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260613T234850Z-phase10-rocm-moe-d1-explicit-thresholds`
  restored ROCm MoE d1 acceptance to 69.9%; Phase 10 remains red because the
  compact outcome/producer wait still prevents a speedup. A later recheck,
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260614T010724Z-phase10-rocm-moe-d1-seeded-threshold-recheck`,
  again rejected production seeded derivation: fixed d1 reached only
  66.7 tok/s with 63.8% acceptance versus a 73.4 tok/s baseline, so explicit
  thresholds remain the production contract.
- A later processed-logit bonus wiring experiment was also benchmark-rejected.
  The primitive stayed useful for instrumentation (`stochastic_processed_rows_build_gpu`),
  but replacing the production compact target+bonus distribution path collapsed
  ROCm MoE d1 acceptance to 12.0% and throughput to 45.96 tok/s in
  `20260614T002748Z-phase10-rocm-moe-d1-lazy-processed-bonus-clean`.
  Restoring the compact bonus row recovered 70.9% acceptance and 69.53 tok/s in
  `20260614T003328Z-phase10-rocm-moe-d1-compact-bonus-restore-clean`. Do not
  reintroduce processed-bonus production sampling until a dedicated
  sampler-trajectory equivalence gate proves compact and processed paths produce
  the same served token stream, including bonus-token consumption.
- The follow-up perfstats row
  `20260614T003922Z-phase10-rocm-moe-d1-compact-bonus-restore-perfstats`
  confirms the remaining ROCm d1 wait is producer work, not byte-copy overhead:
  compact D2H enqueue is 0.36 ms total, while the response bridge waits 949 ms.
  Visible producers are target+bonus distribution build (142 ms), verifier
  forward (215 ms), and prelaunch/sidecar overlap work (93 ms over the short
  lane). The next Phase 10 tuning target should therefore reduce or overlap
  real GPU producer work and move response flushing outside live-state
  scheduling; more D2H copy plumbing is unlikely to change throughput.
- GPU replay attribution now makes that producer work concrete. In
  `20260614T004817Z-phase10-rocm-moe-d1-gpu-replay-attribution`, ROCm fixed d1
  is 64.1 tok/s with 75.5% acceptance under instrumentation, compact D2H wait
  is only 1.1 ms, and `main_verifier_graph_replay_gpu_ms` is 785 ms over 47
  replays, about 16.7 ms per target-verifier replay. The main verifier replay
  plan is 405 captured stages per replay; captured plan metadata now surfaces
  in `stage_summary.tsv` as `graph_replay_plan_stage_types.<TYPE>` rows so
  future matrices can distinguish whole-verifier graph economics from compact
  copy plumbing. The immediate tuning target is the full MoE verifier graph,
  not another host bridge tweak.
- A focused ROCm grouped-MoE regression now mutates route indices and weights
  after graph capture and proves replay still matches eager grouping, so the
  ROCm d3 acceptance collapse is not a low-level routed/shared expert grouping
  bake-in. `DeviceGraphOrchestrator` now distinguishes
  `supportsMTPSidecarPreservesMainState()` from the narrower
  sidecar-replay-after-spec-publication capability. Dense GPU sidecars keep
  replay warm; MoE sidecars recapture after accepted/rejected publication until
  their router/expert transaction metadata is vLLM-style persistent and has a
  full replay equivalence gate.
- The follow-up Release lane
  `20260614T035626Z-phase10-rocm-moe-d3-sidecar-replay-contract-summary` confirms the
  split fixed the normal ROCm d3 acceptance collapse: fixed d3 reaches
  82.0 tok/s versus a 78.6 baseline with 74.3% acceptance, and the matrix
  summary records `sidecar_replay_reset_after_spec_publication=139` at the publication
  boundaries. This moves ROCm MoE stochastic from red correctness/perf collapse
  to amber small-win status. Phase 10 remains open because the target path is
  persistent vLLM-style MoE sidecar metadata, not recurring recapture.
- Phase 10 attribution now promotes verifier stage-type timings into the
  benchmark matrix summary. The ROCm d3 evidence row
  `20260614T041420Z-phase10-rocm-moe-d3-sidecar-reset-timer` shows
  sidecar replay reset is only 10.7 ms total, while main-verifier graph replay
  is 1503 ms. Sampled verifier stage timing is led by MoE expert FFN
  (151 ms), then router (21 ms), GDN projection/recurrence, attention, and
  LM head. This confirms the next vLLM-aligned implementation target is
  persistent/fused MoE verifier execution and device-resident transaction
  metadata, not more compact D2H or reset plumbing.
- ROCm ordinary `seq_len=1` MoE runtime decode now mirrors CUDA's fused
  runtime grouped-decode hook instead of falling back to stage-owned
  gate/up TensorBase scratch handoff. The regression
  `V2_Integration_ROCmMoEKernel` covers fused-vs-two-step equivalence,
  explicit-stream HIP graph capture, and the rule that runtime-table semantic
  validation belongs at graph-build/stage setup boundaries rather than as a
  hot-path D2H check. A bounded real-runner probe,
  `20260614T043812Z-phase10-rocm-moe-d3-fused-runtime-decode`, confirms this
  is a backend-symmetry guard rather than the active MTP verifier bottleneck:
  MoE stochastic verifier rows are `M=3/4` and still use the combined
  routed+shared grouped prefill pipeline, with producer-side sidecar/verifier
  graph work dominating bridge cost.
- Production GPU `seq_len=1` MoE routing now fails closed if the runtime-table
  device route is unavailable, instead of falling through to the legacy
  host-top-k mirror path. Snapshot builds keep their diagnostic host
  materialization path for parity dumps. Focused gates:
  `V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy` and `V2_Unit_MoERoutingStage`.
- GPU full-local Qwen3.6 MoE decode graphs now publish the runtime placement
  bank from prepared expert descriptors before routing runs. This closes the
  production gap exposed by the fail-closed guard: a valid CUDA/ROCm single-row
  MoE graph gets the device runtime-table path, while unsupported ownership
  still hard-fails. `Qwen35MoEGraph::resetState()` now preserves placement
  banks and clears only decode histograms, so request resets cannot silently
  erase persistent Phase 9.6 metadata. Focused gates:
  `V2_Unit_MoEForbiddenDependencyScan`,
  `V2_Unit_Qwen35MoEGraph`, `V2_Unit_MoERoutingStage`, and
  `V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy`.
- The tuning dashboard has been reshaped into an explicit device/topology
  matrix covering SingleDevice, LocalTP CUDA2, LocalTP ROCm2/ROCm4, LocalPP,
  NodeLocalTP, and ExpertOverlay with RAG columns for dense/MoE and
  greedy/stochastic. Missing benchmark lanes must stay amber/red until a fresh
  same-run matrix exists for that exact mode and degree.
- Qwen3.6 MoE all-position accepted-state publication is not currently
  accepted on CUDA or ROCm. A fresh 2026-06-18 focused repro failed
  `MainVerifierPublishedStateMatchesSerialContinuation` on both backends even
  though the isolated combined routed/shared verifier kernels pass their strict
  serial-row oracle. The all-position/full-prefill shortcut is therefore a
  diagnostic only; Phase 9.8 acceptance must come from decode-equivalent
  grouped stage kernels that prove the full verifier/publish path with cosine,
  relative L2, symmetric KL, continuation, and benchmark economics.
- CUDA/ROCm GDN and short-conv verifier publication now refresh both the
  backend-owned device state and the hybrid KV cache host mirrors from the
  accepted verifier row. This fixed the CUDA Qwen3.6 MoE continuation
  divergence where publication was device-correct but a later graph rebuild
  resumed from stale host hybrid state. Direct CUDA/ROCm GDN tests assert that
  the host mirror equals the accepted snapshot row, and the CUDA MoE
  published-state parity regression passed after the fix.
- CUDA/ROCm ring-KV device publication now mirrors truncate semantics instead
  of advancing by `accepted_state_count`. The previous count/head mix could
  publish `count=target` while leaving the head at a rejected verifier row,
  producing decode-equivalent continuation drift on ROCm Qwen3.6 MoE. Device
  kernels and host adoption now preserve the current ring tail and set
  `head=tail+target_cached_tokens`; `accepted_state_count` remains metadata for
  validation/accounting. Focused gates:
  `V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy`,
  `V2_Integration_{CUDA,ROCm}RingKVCache*`, and
  `Qwen36MoEROCmSingleDevicePrefixMTPParity.MTPBenchmarkStyleDepth1EightTokensMatchesReference`.
- The Phase 10 multi-row grouped MoE kernel guard is now green on CUDA and
  ROCm. Qwen3.6 MoE `VerifierRowsGroupedDecodeEquivalentM1/2/3/4` pass strict
  full-continuation, cosine, relative-L2, symmetric-KL, max-absolute, and token
  checks on both backends. CUDA's root cause was tiny FP32 GDN alpha/beta
  projections going through cuBLAS, which can pick different legal reduction
  schedules for M=1 versus M=2..4; CUDA now uses the deterministic
  workspace-backed tiny FP32 projection kernel for verifier-sized rows. ROCm's
  root cause was scoped one-token replay mutating `params_.routing_indices` and
  `params_.routing_weights`; the grouped verifier now copies every row from the
  immutable full route tensors before temporarily rebinding params to scratch.
  Focused gates passed:
  `GDNProjectionStageFusesCUDAQuantizedQKVAndZSmallM`,
  `GDNProjectionStage_Qwen36MixedCodebooks_M4MatchesFourM1StageRows`,
  `GDNProjectionStage_Qwen36MoEQ6K_M234MatchesSerialStageRows`, dense CUDA
  grouped verifier M=2/3/4, MoE CUDA grouped verifier M=1/2/3/4, MoE ROCm
  grouped verifier M=1/2/3/4, and
  `Test__ROCmMoEKernel.TokenRowPublicationTopK2SurvivesSnapshotSync`.
- CUDA Qwen3.6 MoE verifier-row continuation previously had segmented-capture
  ordering bugs, but those are no longer the dominant blocker. Attention,
  GDN/short-conv, KV publication, stream handoff guards, tiny FP32 GDN
  projection, and route-row publication are strict on CUDA/ROCm. Phase 10 must
  now re-benchmark direct publication and attack grouped verifier economics
  before treating the lane as speed-accepted.
- `V2_Perf_MoEVerifierPrefill` now shares the `RealModel_Perf` CTest resource
  lock with dense verifier-row perf probes. This keeps CTest parallel for
  unrelated work while preventing concurrent CUDA/ROCm timing tests from racing
  on the same accelerator and producing false verifier-economy failures.
- Direct device-resident stochastic publication now skips success-path live
  checkpoint capture even for hybrid MoE runners that cannot restore debug
  replay from a token-count-only logical checkpoint. The direct path is gated by
  sidecar main-state preservation, device-resident publication, GPU stochastic
  verification, and debug replay checks being off; replay/probe modes still keep
  payload checkpoints. Focused gate passed:
  `V2_Unit_(PrefillDecodeTransition|DeviceGraphOrchestrator)` plus CUDA/ROCm
  Qwen3.6 MoE Prefix+MTP sidecar-preservation, M=2/3/4 device-resident
  publication, and stochastic verifier parity (`15/15`). Bounded sweep
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260618T152655Z_phase10_moe_direct_publication_logical_base`
  shows `checkpoint_ms=0` on CUDA and ROCm, but Phase 10 remains red: CUDA best
  fixed d1 is 27.6 tok/s versus 130.8 baseline, and ROCm best fixed d1 is
  18.6 tok/s versus 79.8 baseline. A clean served-inference rerun without GPU
  stage timing,
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260618T153153Z_phase10_moe_direct_publication_logical_base_clean`,
  is also red: CUDA best fixed d1 is 23.9 tok/s versus 130.7 baseline, and ROCm
  best fixed d1/dynamic is 19.2 tok/s versus 78.4 baseline. The remaining target
  is verifier graph replay economics, especially MoE expert/router work and
  stochastic outcome producer waits.
- After the full-local runtime-table publication and reset-preservation fix,
  the bounded 16-token MoE stochastic sweep
  `20260618T193035Z/193245Z/193422Z` proves the production route is real but
  still uneconomical: CUDA baseline/d1/d2/d3/dynamic is approximately
  139.2/32.6/36.6/36.1/37.3 tok/s, and ROCm is
  84.7/23.3/25.7/25.2/23.3 tok/s. The next Phase 10 target is grouped
  verifier economics, not route fallback cleanup.
- Decode-equivalent replay publication no longer captures the discard-only
  post-sidecar checkpoint when the runner proves that sidecar execution
  preserves main state. The focused unit
  `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition` asserts the skipped checkpoint and
  unchanged restore semantics; CUDA/ROCm Qwen3.6 MoE
  `MTPBenchmarkStyleDepth1EightTokensMatchesReference` parity passed after a
  relink. The short d3 sweep
  `20260618T194327Z-iteration-matrix-e790137b` cuts hybrid export captures from
  36 to 17/16 and improves CUDA/ROCm d3 to 45.0/30.4 tok/s, but Phase 10
  remains red because shared stepwise verifier forward is still the dominant
  cost.
- A full short fixed-depth refresh after that slice,
  `20260618T195352Z-iteration-matrix-e790137b` plus matching baseline
  `20260618T195638Z-iteration-matrix-e790137b`, confirms the next target:
  CUDA MoE stochastic baseline/d1/d2/d3/dynamic is
  `139.5/42.8/46.5/46.3/45.6` tok/s and ROCm is
  `84.3/28.6/30.0/30.3/28.9` tok/s. Grouped-outcome evidence without direct
  accepted-state publication is not economical; adding an all-position grouped
  outcome and then replaying accepted rows would likely double verifier work.
  The next implementation slice must either make grouped MoE publication
  continuation-strict or replace replay with an equivalent device-resident
  transaction.
- Full continuation proof failure diagnosis: the proof was green, but the
  GPU MoE capability gate still advertised replay-only semantics. After
  promoting CUDA/ROCm single-device MoE to device-resident all-position
  publication, `MainVerifierDeviceResidentPublicationM[2-4]MatchesSerialContinuation`,
  `MTPStochasticSamplingVerifierRuns`, and `V2_Unit_DeviceGraphOrchestrator`
  pass. Fresh release sweep `20260618T202155Z-iteration-matrix-e790137b`
  was captured while the direct path was active
  (`decode_equivalent_stochastic_forward_one=0`, direct-publication counters
  present, checkpoint skips recorded), but speed was still red:
  CUDA MoE stochastic `138.2/28.2/26.6/26.0/26.5` tok/s and ROCm
  `85.0/19.3/17.7/16.7/18.9`. The remaining blocker is grouped verifier graph
  economics, led by MoE expert FFN/router/shared expert work, not replay
  publication.
- The next continuation-proof investigation narrowed the active MoE drift to
  the single-table grouped routed+shared expert shortcut. That shortcut has now
  been removed entirely, including its device grouping kernels and perf tests.
  Grouped routed verifier prefill plus decode-equivalent shared expert GEMV-many
  projections and `SharedExpertGate` add is the accepted correctness path. This
  creates measured performance debt, not a fallback contract: Phase 9.8 must
  quantify the split-shared/composite overhead and improve it only through
  strict decode-equivalent kernels with full-continuation, cosine, relative-L2,
  symmetric-KL, max-abs, and token proof.
- The production GPU MoE stochastic path now has a real grouped-outcome
  verifier lane instead of merely advertising grouped capability. The focused
  unit `GroupedOutcomeDeviceResidentPublicationUsesBatchedStochasticVerifier`
  and the neighboring stochastic runner cluster pass. The first bounded probe
  with replay publication (`20260619T-phase10-moe-grouped-outcome-runner-probe3`)
  proved attribution but was unusably slow. The follow-up
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260619T-phase10-moe-grouped-outcome-device-publication-probe2`
  removes row replay/restore from the lane:
  `decode_equivalent_stochastic_forward_one`,
  `grouped_outcome_replay_forward_one`, and
  `grouped_outcome_replay_restore_base_checkpoint` are absent; grouped counters
  show `replay_forward_tokens=0` and `state_publication=device_resident`.
  CUDA fixed d3 reaches 41.2 tok/s at 75.0% acceptance and ROCm reaches
  22.0 tok/s at 78.8%. Publication itself is cheap (CUDA 11.2ms, ROCm 22.1ms
  total over 15 steps), so Phase 10's next blocker is grouped verifier graph
  economics, led by MoE expert/router/shared work and other M=2..4 verifier
  kernels.
- The latest Phase 9.8 grouped-verifier perf pass proves the isolated grouped
  MoE kernels are economical, but it does **not** promote the single-table
  routed+shared shortcut. Fresh `V2_Perf_MoEVerifierPrefill` evidence on the
  current kernels shows CUDA routed M2/M3/M4 at `63.5/75.9/89.7x`, CUDA shared
  at `49.7/72.0/88.8x`, and CUDA `SharedExpertFFNStage` at `7.45/3.80/3.93x`
  versus row-wise decode; ROCm routed is `35.5/24.7/33.0x`, ROCm shared is
  `17.5/21.9/19.8x`, and ROCm `SharedExpertFFNStage` is `23.5/7.5/8.9x`.
  A fresh full CUDA `qwen36` NativeVNNI dispatch refresh generated
  `514,520` sweep rows across `760` cases with `640/640` known-shape coverage
  and `100%` fallback-family coverage. It was kept as evidence rather than
  installed because the existing checked-in broad table is still slightly better
  on mean penalty (`0.44%` vs `0.49%`, same `2.94%` max).
  The Qwen3.6 MoE
  runtime still executes shared-expert verifier stages in the full model, so
  production path guards require the split routed+shared grouped path and reject
  combined counters. The combined shared-gate microbench is only a small win
  over split grouped routed+shared (CUDA `1.14/1.08/1.04x`, ROCm
  `1.10/1.08/1.03x`) and still fails full Qwen3.6 MoE continuation on both CUDA
  and ROCm. A 2026-06-19 repro that temporarily enabled
  `can_combine_shared_verifier` failed strict path guards with CUDA row1
  cosine `0.9955`, relative-L2 `0.0949`, symmetric-KL `0.0151`, max_abs
  `1.7398`, and ROCm row1 cosine `0.9985`, relative-L2 `0.0547`,
  symmetric-KL `0.0153`, max_abs `1.1958`. Production graph promotion is
  therefore hard-disabled with `can_combine_shared_verifier=false` until a
  future full-model cosine/L2/KL/max-abs proof turns green.
- The split-route follow-up tightened two correctness contracts before more
  MoE speed work: `V2_Unit_MoERuntimeTable` now proves decode-histogram reset
  preserves active placement banks and graph-facing runtime-table pointers, and
  `V2_Unit_PrefillGraphCapturability` now rejects `SharedExpertGateStage`
  graph capture until the effective gate tensor is device-resident on the stage
  device. Focused CUDA/ROCm MoE path guards and stochastic verifier parity are
  green after the change. Fresh bounded stochastic fixed-d3 refresh
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260619T233454Z-moe-stochastic-gate-residency-reset-guard`
  shows CUDA `138.70 -> 75.61 tok/s` and ROCm `83.43 -> 74.69 tok/s` at
  `30/39` accepted tokens. The perfstats still report `49 KB` of
  `MTP0_shared_expert_gate` H2D prep, so the next speed slice should separate
  warmup-only weight staging from replay hot-path accounting and then attack
  verifier producer kernels.
- Fresh `V2_Perf_DenseVerifierRows_{CPU,CUDA,ROCm}` shows full dense verifier
  economics are not CPU-dominant: CPU M2/M3/M4 is `1.56/1.76/2.17x`, CUDA is
  `1.50/1.98/2.40x`, and ROCm is `1.28/1.57/1.73x`, all with strict
  cosine/relative-L2/symmetric-KL checks green. CPU component probes still show
  useful local wins, especially Q6_K NativeVNNI GEMV up to `2.42x`, but
  attention (`1.42-1.54x`) and GDN (`1.02-1.37x`) cap full-verifier economics.
  This shifts the near-term performance target toward ROCm full-verifier graph
  economics and MoE production composition, not a CPU-only verifier rewrite.
- A follow-up ROCm dense verifier slice promoted the decode-equivalent
  single-projection NativeVNNI path from row-parallel packed-weight decode to a
  shared small-M kernel that preserves serial-M1 split-K order. The all-codebook
  ROCm GEMV integration test now forces the production decode-equivalent policy
  and gates relative L2, cosine, symmetric KL, and max-absolute error. Focused
  dense perf improved ROCm grouped M4 forward from about `78 ms` to `60 ms`,
  with grouped `GEMM` stage time dropping from about `37.6 ms` to `18.3 ms`.
  The narrow production fixed-d3 dense run reached `55.49 tok/s` with `15/18`
  accepted tokens; accepted-state host bridge time was only `0.36 ms`, making
  proposal-token D2H sync and terminal-hidden publication the next dense
  host-bridge/accounting targets.
- A follow-up host-bridge accounting slice proved that naive greedy draft-token
  host deferral is unsafe while the production chain uses the fused
  `forwardMTPFromLastDraftAndSampleGreedyToDeviceDraftSlot()` API: that fused
  path still consumes a host condition token, so passing the internal deferred
  shadow `-2` crashes the sidecar. The safe non-fused device-slot deferral path
  is unit-covered, and the production fixed-d3 ROCm dense guard run is green at
  `56.61 tok/s` with `15/18` accepted tokens. The next structural target is a
  fused device-draft-slot sidecar API that samples the next draft into a device
  slot without materializing the previous draft token on the host.
- The fused device-draft-slot sidecar API is now implemented for the greedy
  grouped publication lane. `forwardMTPFromDeviceDraftAndSampleGreedyToDeviceDraftSlot()`
  consumes the previous draft from the runner-owned device slot, samples the
  next draft into a device slot, and treats the host shadow as optional. Focused
  `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition` coverage proves both the production fused
  chain and the non-fused device-slot chain defer draft host reads safely.
  `V2_Integration_ROCm_NativeVNNI_GEMV` and `V2_Perf_DenseVerifierRows_ROCm`
  remain green. The refreshed ROCm dense fixed-d3 run is
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260619T165244Z_rocm_dense_greedy_fused_device_draft_retry`
  at `55.37 tok/s`, `15/18` accepted tokens. Proposal-token D2H sync is gone,
  compact outcome host bridge is `0.39 ms`, and the remaining dense bottleneck
  is grouped verifier forward (`370 ms` over 6 measured steps).
- The follow-up ROCm dense bridge-accounting run
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260619T_rocm_dense_greedy_bridge_split`
  splits compact response materialization into response-ready wait, D2H enqueue,
  and D2H wait. Fixed d3 is `52.06 tok/s` with `30/39` accepted tokens. The
  legacy D2H-sync bucket is `464.6 ms`, but `463.6 ms` is waiting for verifier
  producer work; actual D2H wait is only `0.36 ms` and enqueue is `0.21 ms`.
  This closes the host-bridge accounting ambiguity and points the next ROCm
  dense sprint at grouped verifier graph economics rather than more copy plumbing.
- Tiny-M verifier projections now prioritize decode-equivalent row kernels over
  cuBLAS/small-M fused routes where strict M=1 versus M=2..4 equivalence demands
  it. This fixed CUDA GDN alpha/beta drift, but it is explicit performance debt:
  Phase 9.8 acceptance requires measuring the impact and replacing any slow
  row route with trained/generated M=2/3/4 dispatches that cover CUDA, ROCm,
  CPU, and the full Q/K/IQ codebook surface without ad hoc per-format
  exceptions.
- Grouped-outcome stochastic publication now prelaunches the next first sidecar
  from the device-resident publication mailbox before the compatibility host
  bridge. The focused unit gate `V2_Unit_PrefillDecodeTransition` proves the
  prelaunch is mailbox-owned (`prelaunch_timing=pre_bridge`) and the CUDA/ROCm
  Qwen3.6 MoE grouped/stochastic parity cells pass. The event-timed profiled
  sweep `20260619T-moe-stochastic-profiled-grouped-mailbox-prebridge` showed
  compact D2H wait as CUDA `0.3 ms` and ROCm `3.1 ms`, but a production-speed
  rerun without `--gpu-stage-timing`
  (`20260619T-moe-stochastic-real-speed-mailbox-prebridge`) proves ROCm still
  drains about `4.0 s` of producer work at the compact outcome bridge. CUDA MoE
  stochastic fixed d3 is `144.2` versus `146.4 tok/s` baseline; ROCm is `77.6`
  versus `85.5`. The next target is making grouped verifier/top-k/sidecar
  producer work economical enough that the required host response flush has
  nothing large left to synchronize.
- The release `V2_Perf_GPUSpeculativeSummary` gate is green after rebuilding the
  exact perf target. The Qwen3.6-vocab compact stochastic path remains the
  economical reducer: CUDA rows 1/2/3 are about `1.59/1.91/2.13 ms`, ROCm
  rows 1/2/3 about `5.13/5.80/6.51 ms`. Processed-logit and processed-target
  variants are correct but slower for this production-shaped microbench, so
  Phase 10 should not promote them without a new same-run production speed win
  and sampler-trajectory proof.
- CUDA MoE stochastic now has a concrete graph-economics win from removing
  false attention verifier recaptures. `AttentionComputeStage` capture
  signatures mirror the real CUDA flash-decode split cap instead of raw
  `kv_len / 16`; focused attention signature units pass, and the narrow
  production-speed MoE run
  `20260619T101109Z-moe-cuda-attn-signature-cap` improved fixed d3 from the
  prior `144.2 tok/s` to `169.4 tok/s` while
  `decode_segmented_variant_recapture` dropped `46 -> 0`.
- A later same-run MoE stochastic laggard refresh shows the active lane is not
  yet speed-accepted. Clean-speed fixed d3 with `76.9%` acceptance measured
  CUDA `138.5` versus `139.3 tok/s` baseline and ROCm `69.4` versus
  `84.8 tok/s` baseline. The matching perfstats run attributed CUDA cost mainly
  to verifier forward (`277 ms`) and sidecar work (`42.7 ms`) with a tiny
  bridge wait (`0.83 ms`), while ROCm still pays verifier forward (`328 ms`),
  stochastic distribution build (`57.8 ms`), first-sidecar prelaunch
  (`121.5 ms`), and compact outcome bridge wait (`192 ms`). The next Phase 10
  optimization target is therefore ROCm producer/prelaunch/bridge economics and
  CUDA verifier/top-k work, not acceptance tuning.
- The focused grouped-vs-serial perf pass now includes Qwen3.6 MoE Q6_K
  production projection groups in the ROCm batched decode trainer. A trainer
  partial-buffer bug was fixed by matching the 64-plane split-K cap used by the
  ROCm NativeVNNI launcher; KB16/KB32 variants now produce rows instead of GPU
  faults. `Qwen36MoE_GDN_Q6K_qkv_z` strict rows show best KB/TW wins over AUTO
  of M2/M3/M4 `1.18/1.13/1.28x` with cosine `1.0` and rel-L2 about
  `1.6e-7..2.2e-7`; MoE expert gate/up and down are already AUTO-best. The
  next backend-specific gap is giving ROCm Q8_0/direct small-M grouped rows the
  same trainer/generator coverage before any model-speed promotion.
- ROCm Q8_0/direct small-M now has the same trainer/generator coverage as the
  other NativeVNNI codebooks. `Perf__NativeVNNI_Throughput` can explicitly
  materialize a codebook-19 NativeVNNI payload from `IINT8Unpackable` when the
  default ROCm packer keeps Q8_0 on the INT8 scatter route. The qwen36-moe
  refresh profile now includes Q8_0 for ROCm, and the installed generated decode
  include has Q8_0 MoE projection rows for M=1..4. Focused trainer evidence:
  per-projection Q8_0 NativeVNNI beats INT8 scatter by up to `2.31x` on M2..4,
  generated AUTO resolves the trained keys, and grouped Q8_0 rows pass cosine
  `1.0` with rel-L2 around `1e-7`. This removes Q8_0 as a pipeline gap; Phase 10
  still needs end-to-end ROCm MoE stochastic speed work in verifier/top-k/
  producer economics before promotion.
- Shared-expert verifier rows now use a backend-neutral verifier-mode scope:
  stages request `ITensorGemm::beginVerifierDecodeEquivalentScope()` and keep one
  RAII scope per backend class while running grouped verifier publication or
  serial replay. CUDA's scope selects canonical NativeVNNI small-M dispatch and
  disables prefill/concurrent decode reordering without process-wide
  `LLAMINAR_DETERMINISTIC`; ROCm uses the same interface for its generated
  decode-equivalent policy. The serial replay oracle also bypasses the normal
  grouped shared-expert decode shortcut so it compares against canonical M=1
  GEMM/SwiGLU/down rows. Focused gates now pass for CUDA and ROCm
  `SharedExpertFFNStage` M=2/3/4 across all Q, K, and IQ codebooks with strict
  cosine, relative-L2, KLD, and max-abs checks. This closes the all-codebook
  shared-expert correctness gap; Phase 10 still needs end-to-end MoE speed work
  for routed/shared composition and remaining verifier producer cost.
- The standalone shared-expert grouped verifier route is now treated as the
  promoted CUDA/ROCm graph policy whenever grouped prefill is enabled; the failed
  single-table routed+shared shortcut remains hard-disabled. Focused gates
  `V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy` and `V2_Perf_MoEVerifierPrefill` pass.
  A fresh bounded SingleDevice MoE speed refresh at
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260619T231915Z-moe-stochastic-split-verifier-regression-fix`
  shows acceptance recovered after rejecting the combined owner in production:
  CUDA stochastic fixed d3 is `138.87 -> 75.15 tok/s` (`0.54x`) and ROCm is
  `84.81 -> 73.32 tok/s` (`0.86x`), both at `30/39` accepted tokens. The
  remaining blocker is full verifier producer economics: CUDA spent about
  `539.7 ms` in verifier forward in the bounded run, while ROCm spent about
  `307.2 ms` plus `110.1 ms` in first-sidecar prelaunch and `166.8 ms` response
  readiness wait.
- The stale routed-to-shared verifier graph dependency is now removed for the
  promoted standalone shared verifier route. That route uses branch-local
  GEMV-many decode-equivalent math instead of backend MoE grouped-prefill
  scratch, so the graph no longer serializes it behind routed expert FFN merely
  for historical scratch-race reasons. Focused gates passed:
  `V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy`,
  `Qwen36MoE_{CUDA,ROCm}_SingleDevice_*GroupedVerifierUsesRoutedPrefillPath`,
  and CUDA/ROCm `VerifierRowsGroupedDecodeEquivalentM2`. A bounded Release
  refresh at
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260619T195526Z_moe_split_branch_dependency`
  confirms this is necessary but not sufficient: CUDA stochastic fixed d3 is
  `139.3 -> 75.1 tok/s` and ROCm is `84.0 -> 69.9 tok/s`. The next Phase 10
  slice must implement real branch-side concurrency or a decode-equivalent fused
  producer; graph-edge cleanup alone does not eliminate the producer cost.
- Request-boundary graph reuse now follows the intended production/server model:
  warmup may build/capture replay-safe decode, sidecar, and exact bucketed
  prefill graphs, while later request boundaries clear live KV/GDN/session
  state without tearing down those executables. `clear_cache()` now calls the
  replay-preserving forward/sidecar reset path, preserves kernel dynamic pointer
  tables that captured CUDA/HIP graph nodes reference, and records
  `live_prefix_replay_state_after_mutation` with
  `forward_replay_reset_scope=request_boundary_preserve`. Hard
  `clearInferenceState()` still reports and performs a full replay/kernel
  reset. Focused gates passed:
  `V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy`,
  `V2_Unit_ForwardGraphTypes`, `V2_Unit_PrefillGraphCache`,
  `V2_Integration_PrefillGraphCacheExecution_{CUDA,ROCm}`,
  `V2_Integration_MultiTurnSessionReset`, and CUDA/ROCm Qwen3.6 MoE
  stochastic depth-3/dynamic request-reset parity. A bounded Release refresh at
  `benchmark_results/mtp_vllm_style/20260620T_request-replay-preserve-fix`
  restored CUDA MoE stochastic fixed d3 from the recapture/regression lane to
  `99.93 tok/s` with `30/39` accepted tokens and `sidecar_replay_reset_ms=0`;
  ROCm posted `80.19 tok/s` with the same acceptance. Phase 10 remains open
  because CUDA is still below its no-MTP baseline and ROCm is only near
  break-even; the next target is verifier graph economics, not request recapture.
- Bucketed prefill graph capture is now default-on. Request-boundary reset
  preserves armed Warmup entries as well as Ready executables, so repeated
  same-key served requests progress through build+warmup -> capture -> replay
  instead of warming every request. The initial cache miss now runs on the
  dedicated prefill capture stream and arms Warmup after successful preflight.
  The E2E server harness has a `prefill-graph-probe` option that sends three
  identical long-enough prompts and requires perfstats `prefill_graph_phase`
  records for both capture and replay. Focused CUDA and ROCm probes passed:
  `20260620_045923_*prefill-graph-probe-cuda*.perfstats.json` and
  `20260620_045943_*prefill-graph-probe-rocm*.perfstats.json`, each showing one
  `warmup`, one `capture`, and one `replay` record for the same 2048-token
  bucket.
- No default-enable proposal is allowed until the active dashboard matrix has
  same-run parity and benchmark evidence for the exact backend/model/sampling
  lanes under consideration.

## Iteration Gates

Run these before every WiP commit.

### Required Build

```bash
cmake --build build_v2_integration --parallel
cmake --build build_v2_release --parallel
```

### Hard Commit Gate

All broader Llaminar unit tests must pass and be fixed before a WiP commit:

```bash
ctest --test-dir build_v2_integration -R "^V2_Unit_" --output-on-failure --parallel
```

### MTP Unit Gate

```bash
ctest --test-dir build_v2_integration \
  -R "^V2_Unit_(PrefixMTPConfig|MTPDepthController|MTPDecodeCatchup|MTPRejectionSampler|MTPSpecDecodeTransaction|MTPSpecDecodeMetadata|MTPSpecStateContract|MTPSpecKVPublisher|MTPStateTransaction|MTPVerifierPolicy|MTPWeightManifest|MTPGraphConstruction|PrefillDecodeTransition|PrefillGraphCacheIntegration|ForwardExecutionEngineAdvanced)" \
  --output-on-failure --parallel
```

### Generated Dispatch Gate

Run after touching NativeVNNI sweep, trainer, generated include, or CUDA/ROCm
decode dispatch code:

```bash
ctest --test-dir build_v2_integration \
  -R "V2_Unit_Static_NoDefaultStreamInGPUCode|V2_Unit_GpuWorkspaceAllocationPolicy|V2_Unit_NativeVNNIDispatchRefreshScript|V2_Unit_CUDAGemvDispatchGeneratorAliases|V2_Unit_CUDAGemvDispatchBaseMerge|V2_Unit_ROCmNativeVNNIDecodeTrainerGenerator|V2_Unit_ROCmNativeVNNITrainerCsvValidator|V2_Unit_NativeVNNIGeneratedDispatchCodebooks" \
  --output-on-failure --parallel
```

Use `scripts/refresh_native_vnni_dispatch_tables.sh --backend both --profile qwen36`
for table refreshes. Install generated tables only after model-level parity and
benchmark acceptance for the affected backend/model lanes.

### Functional/Parity Gate

Run the relevant available lanes for any touched backend:

```bash
ctest --test-dir build_v2_integration \
  -R "^V2_Integration_Parity_Qwen36.*(PrefixMTP|Math|GraphStreamStress)|^V2_Integration_PrefixCacheMTP_Qwen36.*(GpuGraphs|Smoke|Prefix)" \
  --output-on-failure --parallel
```

This must cover, as applicable:

- Dense CPU/CUDA/ROCm greedy MTP and prefix restore.
- Dense CPU/CUDA/ROCm stochastic MTP. CPU may use host kernels, but it must use
  the same batched verifier/rejection contract; CUDA/ROCm must use
  device-resident stochastic verification.
- Dense CPU/CUDA/ROCm layer-by-layer math prefill/decode parity.
- Seeded stochastic sampler parity for saved real-model logits must be symmetric
  across CPU/CUDA/ROCm so backend drift cannot hide behind aggregate counters.
- Dense CUDA/ROCm GPU graph smokes.
- MoE CPU/CUDA/ROCm layer-by-layer math prefill/decode parity.
- MoE CUDA greedy MTP parity/style tests.
- MoE CPU/CUDA/ROCm stochastic verifier parity and deterministic reuse after
  `clearCache()`.
- ROCm MoE ExpertOverlay parity remains separate from SingleDevice acceptance.

### E2E Server Gate

The release E2E server harness must include real served-inference coverage for:

- Existing Qwen2.5/Qwen3.5 CPU, CUDA, ROCm, TP, and PP smoke lanes.
- Qwen3.6 dense and Qwen3.6 MoE SingleDevice CPU, CUDA, and ROCm baseline
  lanes. Bare `cpu` is intentional here because the served E2E path should
  cover the dual-socket NodeLocal CPU configuration, not just `cpu:0`.
- Qwen3.6 dense and MoE prefix-cache server lanes with RAM storage and terminal
  state restore policy enabled.
- Qwen3.6 dense and MoE MTP server lanes with fixed greedy draft-depth coverage.
- Qwen3.6 MoE LocalTP feature lanes for 2x CUDA, 2x ROCm, and 4x ROCm. Each
  LocalTP degree must run both RAM prefix-cache and fixed-depth MTP server
  variants so cache restore, shifted MTP state, and TP collectives are covered
  by the same HTTP/SSE/shutdown checks as SingleDevice.
- Qwen3.6 MoE ExpertOverlay feature lanes for the target production tiered
  residency shapes: 2x ROCm hot plus 2x CPU cold, 2x CUDA hot plus 2x CPU cold,
  and 2x CUDA hot plus 2x ROCm warm plus 2x CPU cold. These lanes must run
  prefix-cache and MTP variants with the placement-fingerprint policy so
  overlay placement remains a first-class restore contract. Overlay E2E domains
  must declare deterministic ownership with `owner=` or `ranks=`; ambiguous
  domains are validation failures, not acceptable best-effort launches.

Current ExpertOverlay production status:

- Root-owned local overlay execution is the accepted path today. Existing
  parity covers ROCm2TP-hot plus CPU2LocalTP-cold where the root rank owns the
  graph-native sparse dispatch, local expert, and return-reduce work.
- Remote CPU-cold and warm participant ranks are intentionally fail-closed in
  production. A failed ROCm2+CPU2 served E2E attempt proved that wiring
  non-root ranks through a scalar `MoEGraphRoleRunner` creates unmatched MPI
  ordering against the root graph and can deadlock.
- The remote ExpertOverlay E2E lanes remain off the default server gate until a
  real participant graph exists: root and non-root ranks must run matched
  `MoEOverlayMPISparseCollectiveContext` dispatch, local-expert, and
  return-reduce stages for every request/decode step. Once that integration
  gate is green, enable the three target overlay suites in the default E2E
  harness.

Feature variants run the normal REST request matrix and skip only duplicate
optional long-context helpers; baseline Qwen3.6 lanes remain eligible for the
long-context stress path. Prefix-cache probes validate their own shared-prefix
answers, while generic OpenAI response-format checks use the ordinary
cache-clear response so feature probes do not become brittle when a thinking
model exhausts its token budget after already producing the checked answer.

### Mandatory Benchmark Matrix Gate

Refresh JSON/perf evidence for the same SingleDevice device matrix on every
tuning iteration: CUDA, ROCm, and CPU; dense and MoE; greedy and stochastic;
no-MTP baseline, fixed d1, fixed d2, fixed d3, and dynamic depth. Multi-device
Phase 9 lanes use the same script with `--topologies` presets so LocalTP,
LocalPP, NodeLocalTP, and ExpertOverlay evidence lands in the same schema. This
matrix is the normal tuning instrument, not an occasional acceptance run. Greedy rows use
production runtime settings with `--temperature 0`, not `--deterministic`;
stochastic rows use a pinned seed, default `123`, so acceptance and throughput
can be compared across iterations. Dynamic depth must always be reported beside
the fixed d1/d2/d3 rows from the same git hash and runtime configuration; do not
tune or accept dynamic in isolation. The standard matrix dynamic lane starts at
d1 and keeps d1 as the adaptive floor; d0 bypass must be run as an explicit
diagnostic until it is proven faster than d1 on a matching benchmark. The
generated `summary.tsv` includes
`speedup_vs_baseline` for every MTP row plus perfstats-derived verifier health:
`verifier_ms`, `stochastic_physical_verify_rows`,
`stochastic_semantic_verify_rows`, `stochastic_post_reject_rows`,
`condition_ms/count/skipped_ready`, `rejection_no_ready`, `correction_ms`,
`publish_ms/count/avg_ms`,
`sidecar_ms`, `sidecar_depth0_decode_ms`, `shifted_*_ms`, `sampling_ms`,
`shifted_kv_ready_events/waits/syncs_deferred`, `checkpoint_ms`,
`sidecar_graph_hits/misses`,
`shifted_initial_commits/reused`,
`main_decode_warmup/capture/replay`, `main_verifier_warmup/capture/replay`,
and replay reset/preserve counts. Use
those fields to explain a speed regression before changing kernels or depth
policy.

Use `cpu:0` for the SingleDevice CPU lane. Bare `cpu` auto-selects two-socket
CPU TP and belongs to a later multi-device/TP matrix, not this gate.

For CPU dynamic-depth work, also run the focused policy-overhead perf test so
controller cost stays separated from model verifier/publication cost:

```bash
ctest --test-dir build_v2_release -R "^V2_Perf_MTPDepthController$" \
  --output-on-failure --parallel
```

```bash
cmake --build build_v2_release --parallel
scripts/run_mtp_iteration_benchmark_matrix.sh --perfstats
```

The full default matrix is the acceptance capture. For inner-loop tuning, keep
the same device/model/mode/variant shape but bound the decode length so CPU and
MoE lanes remain practical:

```bash
scripts/run_mtp_iteration_benchmark_matrix.sh \
  --decode-tokens 16 --perfstats
```

When aggregate MTP timers are ambiguous, add graph-stage GPU event timing to the
same bounded matrix shape:

```bash
scripts/run_mtp_iteration_benchmark_matrix.sh \
  --decode-tokens 16 --perfstats --gpu-stage-timing
```

For Phase 9 multi-device evidence, select the topology preset under active
work. These rows are intentionally opt-in because they require matching local
hardware or MPI process availability:

```bash
scripts/run_mtp_iteration_benchmark_matrix.sh \
  --topologies localtp_rocm2,localpp_rocm2,nodelocaltp_cpu2 \
  --models dense --decode-tokens 16 --perfstats

scripts/run_mtp_iteration_benchmark_matrix.sh \
  --topologies expert_overlay_rocm2_cpu2 \
  --models moe --modes greedy --decode-tokens 16 --perfstats
```

For narrow diagnostic loops, keep the same variant shape while selecting the
lane under active work. These runs can guide a fix, but they do not replace the
bounded or full matrix capture for iteration evidence:

```bash
scripts/run_mtp_iteration_benchmark_matrix.sh \
  --devices cuda:0 --models moe --modes greedy,stochastic \
  --variants baseline,fixed_d1,fixed_d2,fixed_d3,dynamic --perfstats
```

Update `docs/v2/projects/2026-06/MTP_VLLM_STYLE_TUNING_DASHBOARD.md` after every benchmark pass.
If a row cannot run because of hardware availability, build failure, timeout, or
runtime crash, record that explicit reason in the dashboard instead of leaving
the row stale.
