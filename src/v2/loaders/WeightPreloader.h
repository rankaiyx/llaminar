/**
 * @file WeightPreloader.h
 * @brief Pre-packs model weights before graph execution
 *
 * WeightPreloader ensures all model weights are packed for their target devices
 * before inference begins. This eliminates first-use packing overhead during
 * graph execution and allows memory to be released early.
 *
 * Supports:
 * - CPU: VNNI INT8 packing for AVX-512 kernels
 * - CUDA: INT8 + per-column scales for CUTLASS kernels
 * - ROCm: (future) similar to CUDA
 *
 * Usage:
 *   auto preloader = WeightPreloader(weight_manager, placement_map);
 *   preloader.preloadAll();  // Pack all weights before inference
 *
 * @see WeightManager for weight loading
 * @see WeightPlacementMap for device assignment
 * @see KernelFactory::ensurePackedWeightsInTensorCache for packing implementation
