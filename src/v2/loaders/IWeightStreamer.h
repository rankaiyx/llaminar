 * @file IWeightStreamer.h
 * @brief Interface for weight streaming between host and device memory
 * @author David Sanftenberg
 * @date January 2026
 *
 * This file defines the IWeightStreamer interface for Option B (Weight Streaming)
 * in Llaminar V2. Weight streaming enables running models that don't fit entirely
 * in GPU memory by dynamically transferring layer weights on-demand.
 *
 * Design Philosophy:
 * - Layer-granular streaming (one layer at a time)
 * - Async prefetching to hide transfer latency
 * - Phase-aware behavior (PREFILL vs DECODE have different access patterns)
 * - Pluggable eviction policies (LRU, FIFO, etc.)
 * - Zero-copy where possible using pinned memory
 *
 * Usage Pattern:
 *   1. DeviceGraphOrchestrator calls ensureLayerOnDevice() before executing layer stages
 *   2. Streamer uploads weights if not cached, potentially evicting old layers
 *   3. prefetchLayer() called for next layer(s) to overlap with compute
 *   4. releaseLayer() hints that a layer is no longer needed this iteration
 *
 * Memory Management:
 *   - Weights remain in pinned host memory (zero-copy source)
 *   - GPU cache holds recently-used layers within memory budget
 *   - Eviction policy determines which layers to evict when cache is full
 *
 * @see docs/v2/OPTION_B_WEIGHT_STREAMING_DESIGN.md for full design details
