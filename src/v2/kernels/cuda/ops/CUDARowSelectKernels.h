/**

 * @brief CUDA host wrappers for graph-capturable hidden-state row selection.
 *
 * Provides the tiny CUDA runtime surface used by HiddenStateRowSelectStage:
 * pinned host/device scalar allocation, scalar upload, and one fixed-grid row
 * copy kernel. The captured graph records the scalar upload and kernel launch;
 * later replays read the current value from the same pinned host address.
 *
 * Lifecycle: allocation/free are owned by the stage. Kernel launches run on the
 * stream supplied by the graph executor or on the default stream when null.
