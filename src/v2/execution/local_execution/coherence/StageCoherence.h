/**

 * @brief Automatic device coherence management at stage boundaries
 * @author David Sanftenberg
 * @date January 2026
 *
 * Provides infrastructure for automatic tensor coherence at stage entry/exit.
 * This eliminates manual ensureOnDevice()/mark_device_dirty() calls in stages.
 *
 * The coherence system operates at stage boundaries:
 * - ENTRY: Ensures all input tensors are on the target device before execution
 * - EXIT: Marks all output tensors as device-dirty after execution
 *
 * Stages can declare their coherence policy to control automatic behavior:
 * - NONE: No automatic coherence (for MPI stages, custom management)
 * - INPUT: Only cohere inputs (outputs managed manually)
 * - OUTPUT: Only mark outputs dirty (assume inputs are ready)
 * - FULL: Both inputs and outputs (default for most stages)
 *
 * @note Automatic coherence is always enabled. The GraphExecutor handles
 *       coherence automatically at stage boundaries based on each stage's
 *       coherencePolicy().
