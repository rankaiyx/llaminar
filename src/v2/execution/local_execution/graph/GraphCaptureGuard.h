     * @brief Thread-local flag indicating that the current thread is inside
     *        a HIP/CUDA graph capture recording window.
     *
     * During graph capture (between beginCapture/endCapture), many HIP/CUDA
     * operations are illegal:
     *   - hipDeviceSynchronize / cudaDeviceSynchronize
     *   - hipStreamSynchronize / cudaStreamSynchronize (on capture stream)
     *   - hipMemcpy (synchronous variants)
     *   - hipEventSynchronize
     *
     * Code that might call these operations (e.g., TensorBase::ensureOnDevice)
     * can check isGraphCaptureActive() and take a fast path that avoids sync.
     *
     * Usage:
     *   // In capture controller (between beginCapture/endCapture):
     *   {
     *       GraphCaptureGuard guard;  // sets flag true
     *       for (auto& stage : stages)
     *           stage->execute(ctx);
     *   }  // guard destructor sets flag false
     *
     *   // In tensor code:
     *   if (isGraphCaptureActive() && device_valid_)
     *       return true;  // skip sync, data already on device from warmup
     */
