/**
 * @file ForwardExecutionEngine.h
 * @brief Execution engine for forward graph dispatch and caching
 *
 * Extracted from DeviceGraphOrchestrator (Phase 3 of DGO refactor).
 *
 * This engine owns the forward graph cache and handles:
 * - Cache signature computation and lookup
 * - Cache HIT path: buffer updates, PP copy, dynamic params, GPU graph replay
 * - Cache MISS path: graph build via host callback, execution, cache population
 * - GPU stage timeline collection and printing
 *
 * The engine delegates model-specific operations (graph building, device context
 * management, logits sync) to an IForwardExecutionHost interface implemented by
 * the orchestrator.
