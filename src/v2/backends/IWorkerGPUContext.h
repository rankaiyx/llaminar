    /**
     * @brief Abstract interface for GPU device contexts
     *
     * Each GPU device has exactly one context that owns:
     * - The GPU context (CUDA primary context / HIP context)
     * - A dedicated worker thread
     * - Library handles (cuBLAS, hipBLAS, etc.)
     * - Event and stream pools
     * - Collective communicators (when initialized)
     *
     * ## Thread Safety Model
     *
     * This interface follows a strict ownership model where all GPU state is owned
     * by a dedicated worker thread. This eliminates data races and context switching
     * overhead that can occur when multiple threads access the same GPU.
     *
     * **Thread-safe methods** (can be called from any thread):
     * - `deviceOrdinal()`, `deviceName()`, `isInitialized()`
     * - `submitAndWait()`, `submitAsync()`
     * - `synchronize()`
     * - `collectiveComm()` (read-only access)
     *
     * **Worker-thread-only methods** (must be called from within submitted work):
     * - `defaultStream()`, `createStream()`, `destroyStream()`
     * - `createEvent()`, `destroyEvent()`, `recordEvent()`, `waitEvent()`, `synchronizeEvent()`
     * - `blasHandle()`
     * - `setCollectiveComm()` (write access)
     *
     * ## Usage Pattern
     *
     * ```cpp
     * // Submit GPU work from any thread
     * context->submitAndWait([&] {
     *     // Inside here, we're on the worker thread
     *     void* stream = context->defaultStream();
     *     void* handle = context->blasHandle();
     *     // ... launch kernels, call cuBLAS/hipBLAS ...
     * });
     *
     * // Or asynchronously
     * auto future = context->submitAsync([&] {
     *     // GPU work here
     * });
     * // ... do other work ...
     * future.wait();
     * ```
     *
     * ## Platform Abstraction
     *
     * This interface uses `void*` for platform-specific types to keep the header
     * platform-agnostic. Implementations cast these to the appropriate types:
     * - `void*` stream → `cudaStream_t` (CUDA) or `hipStream_t` (ROCm)
     * - `void*` event → `cudaEvent_t` (CUDA) or `hipEvent_t` (ROCm)
     * - `void*` blasHandle → `cublasHandle_t` (CUDA) or `hipblasHandle_t` (ROCm)
     * - `void*` collectiveComm → `ncclComm_t` (NCCL) or `ncclComm_t` (RCCL)
